A12PSSIA6RUKC6	January 1, 2003	5.0	Ann Coulter is not my favorite pundit.  She is given to exaggerations and rather inflammatory rhetoric, not a style I particularly like.  But this book is surprisingly good.  Her hyperbolic style notwithstanding, this book is a well structured for the points she is to make and she proffers an impressive portfolio of evidence and statistics to illustrate and prove those points.  I am impressed with her critical thinking and analysis.  As well I should be, she is an attorney and it shows.  She is amply good at sourcing and presenting evidence to prove her points and does so beyond reasonable doubt. Those points are that the liberals control the media and use it to slander conservative politicians with lies, name-calling, censorship, biased portrayals, and outright attacks while fawning on liberal democrats.  The liberals, Coulter contents, have no respect for the facts and would do anything to win. Needless to say, this book is one-sided, which means that the facts, data, etc., are all selected to support her thesis.  Nonetheless, those who disagree with her seem to choose to attack her person and her motive instead of trying to debate her by proffering counter evidence or noting errors in her book.  Could it be that, as Ann Coulter herself says in the book, that the liberals just can't, because they don't have the facts with them? After reading this book, I am inclined to revise my opinion of her.  Those exaggerations are still there.  But, like a good lawyer, she does her homework very well, and she writes with clarity and force, generous with wit and humor.  Coulter's well-researched accounts left the liberals no place to hide.  "Slander" is both informative and entertaining.
A17898AOMDIIXK	January 12, 2003	5.0	If you take the time to read the negative reviews here on this book, they all attack the author and her political views.  They do not address the issues raised in the book. It's pretty obvious that they have not read the book, and are only engaging in petty attacks based on their political views rather than the facts. Ms. Coulter is bias and makes no apologies for her bias.  Other bias authors are James Carville & Maureen Dowd.  Unlike her liberal counterparts, Ms. Coulter backs up her arguments with extremely well documented facts. That is part of what really drives the liberals nuts.  They can't attack her facts, so they attack her personally.
A1796BFN7L774T	July 17, 2003	5.0	It's hard not to gush about Ann Coulter's "Slander." The book takes the popular political non-fiction genre into new territory, one populated with research, facts, and dead-on analogies, not just hot-breathed opinion and self-righteous indignation, although there's plenty of that too. This fast-paced read is dripping with lucid thinking, crisp sentences, biting sarcasm, and sinus-clearing irony. Liberals will hate it and conservatives will love it. The problem for the left is that the book is so well written that voters in the middle may actually be nudged right, or at least begin to view things in a new light that could slowly swing them that direction over time.  With one example quote after another, Slander focuses on the media's anti-right bias. Much of this is mild and unintentional--there is no vast left-wing conspiracy. But Coulter also points out a plethora of falsehoods and distortions that reach slanderous proportions. Probably the most valuable contribution to the historical record is her analysis of what really took place on election night 2000. It would be nice to see the left's counter to this, something fact-based to back up their claim that Bush "stole the election." Whatever one's political leanings, after reading Slander it'll be hard to read a newspaper or watch the television news without a dose of skepticism and a more critical eye. All in all, that's a good thing in a healthy democracy.
A183ZZ9Y0I4ZDO	October 13, 2002	2.0	I have enjoyed Ann Coulter as a commentator on television. For this reason I was disappointed in SLANDER. She reminded me of some of the liberal attack dogs many of us have learned to discount. The author could have done a better job of exposing the liberal media without indulging in so many of her own personal attacks.
A189SKMLBX9P98	March 6, 2003	3.0	When you read the reviews of this book written by liberals, you realize the subtitle of the book could be "liberals never face reality", or "liberals never learn".  Jim Cooper states that without Marx, we wouldn't have Medicare - is he kidding? Without Reagan, Russia, eastern Europe, and half of African and South America would all be Communist right now, but Cooper may think that's a GOOD thing.  Another reviewer states Coulter doesn't make the case for a liberal media - while Coulter does rant a bit much, anyone who believes she didn't make this point either didn't read the book, or is so liberally biased they think Hillary Clinton is part of a right wing conspiracy.   Remember that the liberal media includes CBS, ABC, NBC, NPR, Time, Newsweek, and most of our big city newspapers - in short, where most people have traditionally gotten their news.  Coulter does a good job showing that these groups seriously distort the news with liberal assumptions, and have been doing so since the days of Walter Cronkite. Liberals whine about right wing talk radio, but most of the hosts of these shows are 'preaching to the choir'.  In years past, you couldn't get away from the liberal slant on the news because there was no place to get the news where you didn't get that slant.  This is changing with the arrival of the more balanced Fox News and their rapidly accelerating ratings. Still, to get a better view of how stupid the liberal world has been, read "Reagan's War". It is 100% documented, and shows conclusively how liberals have been used like tools for the past 50 years by our enemies. But again, liberals NEVER learn.
A198C5THZZJYME	June 28, 2002	5.0	Be warned people.  This book is being targeted by liberals who are going so far as posing as conservatives and giving Ann Coulter's book a one star rating. My advice is BUY THE BOOK and form your own opinion. For the anti-conservative brigade to be out in such numbers Coulter must have really struck a nerve.   Maybe Katie Couric called up all her Manhatten pals and had them write nasty reviews.
A1ASGRO3X620BD	July 6, 2002	5.0	I had to laugh while reading though a bunch of the snarky one star reviews--after reading this book, it was simple to recognize the various liberal "debating tactics" Ann shreds in Slander.  No wonder the libs are foaming mad--she backs up everything with actual footnoted quotes, and provides just enough shrewd analysis to tie it all together.  Beautiful!  This book is much better than her columns, since she has lots of room to build her arguments and back them up with cold, hard facts, so she doesn't resort to her trademark zingers as often.  Still, the claws come out a few times, but that's understandable.  When you read some of the vicious quotes from the liberal media, you find yourself wanting to do a little butt-kicking yourself. If you're a centrist or a libertarian, do yourself a favor and read this book, especially the chapter on the mythical "religious right."  You may find you have more in common with those "mean old conservatives" than the "nice, sweet liberals."   As for hard-core liberals...read the book if you like, but make sure you're in good health or your heart won't be able to take it.
A1AX4VSNGG2HEQ	June 27, 2002	5.0	Ann Coulter's book is full of facts that definitively show the mean spirited and dishonest side of liberalism.   Her prose is as tight as drum.  Her logic and facts slice through opposing arguments like a Sith Lord's double light saber bifurcating the Philsbury Doughboy. This books hosts the standard bogus liberal stereotypes of conservatives on the petard of their own irrational words and hypocritical deeds. And it's a fun, fun read.   Highly recommended
A1BHAM76ZWYKQI	January 15, 2003	4.0	In the book "Bias A Veteran CBS Reporter's Account of how the Media Distorts the News By Bernard Goldberg", a life long Democrat, blew the whistle on the TV networks. He provided vivid detail on numerous personal examples as a network insider. In Slander, there are more than a thousand examples of liberal bias with 780 footnotes sighting the documentation. Another book of examples is on the way by this author based on the C-Span book notes interview with Brian Lamb. Liberal bias is an hourly experience, but these are the most egregious. As lawyer she thinned it down to the examples that make it a devastating case against the management of these publicly traded companies. She was a clerk at a federal appeals court and worked at a major NYC law firm. To deny the media bias would require a steely commitment bad management. Coulter uses colorful, bombastic editorial comments between her facts and sometimes the bitterness is almost unnerving. Somebody has to be upset, given the bias that has developed.   The owners of media shares are only beginning to understand the extent the liberal view dominates the media. For seven consecutive decades, the media's liberal bias has steadily grown to the current situation that it has become a destructive force for the major media companies. Consumers are leaving the TV networks, major magazines and newspapers in a meaningful steady trend. The consumer base will decline to the point that the media companies will experience major management shake ups and investors will loss confidence in the Oligopoly profits they have enjoyed. It's not just the internet and talk radio as Coulter contends, it is the product that major media companies are offering.  As any diligent researcher experiences the media get many of the facts wrong. It is not just liberal bias. The facts are blatantly wrong. The product has become inferior. For example, the Wall Street Journal has been loaded with factual errors for decades. The cable TV stock market shows are a joke when it comes to factual effort. For those of us that need to have the facts right, we have learned to distrust any offering by any major media. It is more than just liberal bias they have become bad products unworthy of consumer trust and support. Why do many individuals launch into emotional arguments over politics that have little or no factual basis? Largely, because the major media outlets do the same. This damages our culture. Increasingly, people are turning to other sources The bias would be easy to fix if the management of the major media companies wanted to solve the problem they are facing. As Coulter documents, the media aggressively hires liberal staffers, bureaucrats and even Democratic elected officials. IT IS EXTREMELY RARE THAT REPUBLICANS ARE HIRED. Conceptually, that should be reversible, but what do you do about the culture that tolerates an inferior product on the basic facts.  Many consumers are oblivious to the fact that the media aggressively supports liberal politicians and agendas and tears down conservatives. As Coulter details, in classic propaganda methods, lies are repeated with such great frequency that the average person believes it must be true. If you are an investor in any major media companies, you had better be very concerned. Media are obviously very poorly managed companies. The greatest managerial sin is to ignore your customers. They have done so in spades. Coulter provides information that conservative read far more books per person than liberals do. This is all part of the same trend. You drop bad products and buy good products. There is little difference from what foreign cars did to domestic cars. There is one important difference. The first amendment will not allow government tampering with the market place. The media is nicely protected by the first amendment and that is just fine. But the media is not protected from its customers and that is just fine. While it may be hard to believe that decades of consumer abuse can be stopped, some how the American people seen to have a way of eventual understanding. When the tide turns and consumers bailout to the Internet they will not be easy to win back. Goldberg describes reporters and editors as "total dunces when it comes to economics" (page 217 in his book). It would appear that managers of media companies suffer from the same malady.
A1F6TUAKKWE5JT	February 9, 2004	1.0	Slander: Liberal Lies about the American Right, by writing Slander about the American Left?  Is it just me, or is that Irony?
A1FD6QQ6SYEFE0	July 4, 2002	5.0	This book should have been written a long time ago.  Coulter hits the target right in the bulls eye.  She has the guts to tell it the way it is.  GOOD JOB ANN!!
A1HUBEP5DJ6W51	July 3, 2002	2.0	First, I am a liberal. I agree with little, if anything, Coulter believes or writes in this book. That said, I did read this book (I had to know what the big deal was, after all) and can say that while it will rile the ideological opposites of Coulter, it will no doubt please all who inhabit the right side of the aisle. The most noticeable trait of Coulter's writings is that while well-reasoned in their own way, they can only make sense if one forgets that there is another side to each and every issue she discusses. If one were to ignore all of the details from other sources, her ideas might make sense. She is the master of "selective evidence," and does not even attempt to provide that which might contradict her beliefs. Still, as a pundit and/or social critic, she is not obligated to do so. She is not a journalist feigning objectivity; she is a self-described conservative cheerleader and would not pretend that she is arguing social science here. She has a worldview, nothing can shake her from it, and this is her 200 page testimonial to her conservative philosophy As a result, in her world all conservatives are perfect, well-intentioned, patriotic, moral, and just. All liberals are immoral, liars, traitors, and opportunistic. Again, she does not ask that her book be analyzed for its journalistic integrity; this is propaganda -- biased, one-sided, and intended to provoke. Coulter is not subtle throughout, and any non-conservative will be uttering "but what about..." or "Yes, but you forgot..." with every page that is turned. She seems to disregard the idea that while certain liberals she mentions are cads and/or dangerous to our moral fabric, conservatives in the political arena are just as guilty, if not more so. She does not hold her idols to the same standards as liberals, and as a result her arguments, while persuasive if read in isolation, simply do not hold up to scrutiny. Coulter also has a "gift" for hyperbole, which is part of her goal -- to rile up the public so that liberals are even further demonized and isolated. She has no sense of perspective, no vision of accuracy, and practices the same tactics (ad hominem attacks and bitter denunciations substituting for debate) she decries in others. As a final thought on this book, it is quite sloppy and could have used some organization and editing. She rambles from one attack to the next, concerned only with "proof" that liberals have destroyed all that is right and good in America. Still, she says what she believes, does not couch anything in polite P.C. discourse, and is unafraid of sacred cows (although her targets are often obvious and too easy), but she is not adding to the political sanity of our culture. Her book has the flavor of old fashioned "criticism" (angry, holier-than-thou, unfair, yet often biting and witty), yet none of the broadmindedness that defined so many of the past. For example, H.L. Mencken was an angry, vicious character, but he attacked the culture as a whole rather than following predictable party lines. She believes there are saints among us; Mencken thought the whole deal was rotten. There is a difference.
A1IDL0RY0K1MRA	September 19, 2002	5.0	I greatly enjoyed this book and ....     Ann Coulter's book is a fearless expose of the truth about the Liberal Establishment and its disengenuous tactics.  She fearlessly weathers the slanderous attacks of the Left for not falling in line.     Coulter's work is well documented and researched.  That doesn't stop Liberals from trying to say she is a liar.  ...
A1KOJO4E89ASOY	June 28, 2002	5.0	Bill O'Reilly began the hunt for truth by asking elementary and tough questions of the filthy rich, overpaid, left leaning elitist in the News Media and entertainment industries. Bernard Goldberg then exposed the middle-school truths about the corruptly biased superstructure of the media and so-called mainstream newsroom anchorpersons and the manipulators of information. Now Ann Coulter puts faces to actions and throws on the finishing touches to the disgustingly open, manipulative and blatant hypocrisies, hate and camouflaged anti-conservative rhetoric of those who falsely profess to be liberal, independent, moderate and/or centrist.  The other day I had the good fortune to watch several interviews between Ann Coulter and a number of clearly liberal and bias talk show hosts and interviewers. The fireworks were magnificent and I could not for the life of me initially understand why all these people who normally hoodwink the American audience with their fake composure, self-control and false sophistication seemed to be so animistic towards her. So, after she beat James Carville down to parade rest for being an interrupting overbearing fool and offensive slob on crossfire. I decide to get into her book, which I had ordered through Amazon.com, immediately received and placed on my shelf for future attention. Fifteen pages into it, I found the answer I was looking for. It was staring me right in the face and continued throughout the book. The reason these people, who have been so grossly overpaid with their six, seven and in some cases idiotic eight figure salaries, were so upset when Ann when she comes onto their shows. Is because she just out classes them so profoundly that they are intimidated. She is so intellectually and educationally beyond their level of competence that they cannot possibly debate, dispute, counter or contradict any of her well-founded assertions. So they simply hate her. They find that they are so far below and out of her class that it drives them nuts.  Mr. Spock once made an observation on the original Star Trek that a newly discovered alien species was so far evolved above humans...that the only appropriate comparison would be human evolution above that of the amoebae. This analogy works perfectly for where Ann Coulter is above these liberal spinners of the news. These, manipulative, intolerant liberal, egotistical charlatans on ABC, NBC and CBS like Ted Koppel, Katie Couric, Dan Rather, Tim Russert, Chris Matthews, Bryant Gumbel, Diane Sawyer, Connie Chung, Mat Lauer and others are simply unable to hold a candle to her in an honest, courteous and professional debate.  As she so aptly says, "it is a stunning reflection on the left's monopoly of the news that an opinionated, partisan talk radio host is more accurate than television news programs." They will try anything to catch her in a way that will allow them to show her up, humiliate her or catch her in a too hastily thought out response to leading or nonsequitur questions. They fail miserably because she is right. They have no basis from which to debate, but to attempt character assassination, word confusion and false innuendoes. The wonderful and challenging verbiage, candidness, interwoven humor and sagacity of this book strikes a note of understanding, of just how this uneven match up would irk these inept liberal interviewers. Only fifteen pages into the book and you realize these misfits, who have helped to dumb down our children and our nation themselves are simply put, dumb compared to the likes of Ms. Coulter. Even I, who prided myself on a rather vast vocabulary, believing as one of our past Presidents, that one should learn and use a new word every day, could not readily keep up with her. I found that I had to place a dictionary and thesaurus next to me while reading to keep from skipping an unfamiliar word. An act I swore I would never do as a child. If nothing else Ann has made many of us aware of our incompetent lack of mastery of the English language. Could this be the lefts negative influence on our public schools, when they care more about outlawing prayer, God or the Pledge of Allegiance and more about teaching the forced acceptance of deviant homosexual conduct...than actually educating us?  The unquestionable command of the English language Ann uses no doubt causes liberals to scamper for their dictionaries and more than likely irks them to no end. This book has placed her head and shoulders above the everyday anchorperson, interviewer and talk show host. I also appreciated the wonderful opportunity she gives us to highlight the good guys from the bad because unlike Bernard Goldberg. She puts the names there of the good, the bad and the hypocritical in plain sight for you to circle, highlight and/or underline for future references.  I once watched Katrina Vanden Heuvel speak at a Democratic Fund Raiser where she just raked conservatives over the verbal rhetorical partisan coals and called them things I did not think appropriate in public discourse and I thought to myself, my, what a neo-leftist fanatically liberal hate-monger she was. Well I think she has finally met her match from the conservative side in Ann Coulter although I must add, Ann fights back superbly and does it with much more style and class. So bring on the titans of the left and the right, "We the People" are sitting in the gallery watching this spectacle unfold. A terrific book, great read and an honest evaluation and no holds barred open exposure of her opponents. This book should be the required main course after Bernard Goldberg's initial appetizer. It exposes the liberal bias run amuck in our society, which produces not one but two idiot Judges who can ban the Pledge of Allegiance merely over the term "under God"...
A1LKAYASYEDFR2	June 30, 2002	5.0	As is always the case with books like this, liberals have come out of the woodwork to write as many one star reviews as possible.  I wonder how man of them actually read this? Ann Coulter has written an intelligent, well-researched, well-laid out, well-argued case against modern liberalism.  Her thesis is that liberals are so smug, so complacent, and so out of touch with the American people, they continue to believe what they want to believe even when the facts indisputably refute them.  Coulter was trained as a lawyer and she has made a slam-dunk case against the American left. One of the more outrageous quotes comes from Congressman Charles Rangel of New York, who said talking about tax cuts is the moral equivalent of using the "n" word.  How do you argue with people like this?  Liberalism has become a fundamentalist religion, complete with zealous acolytes like Rangel, and many others she quotes from. Coulter writes that liberal are incapable of rational argument... I defy any liberal to write a point by point rebuttal of the arguments she makes within the pages of this book. None of them will though.  Why?  After reading this book, arguing that Coulter is wrong is like trying to argue the sky is green.otes so you can corroborate everything she says. The light has been turned on. Sure the attic's FILTHY. But don't blame the light for exposing what's always been there. And don't blame Ann Coulter for shining the light on the horrific left leaning bias in the media. Trust me, it's always been there. (At least in most of our lifetimes.) Isn't it a blessing to finally see the Clinton supporting left wingers be exposed as the American-hating Arab-Supporting enemies of freedom that they are? I mean when you find wholesale numbers of Jewish Americans praising Alan Keyes, you know something is afoot in the American psyche. The mainstreamliberalnewsmedia can't figure it out. (They are ALWAYS the last to know.) But Ann has. It's the reductionist, nihilistic and destructive forces of liberalism that has enbalmed the country into a sort of chronic place of passive non-resistance which in turn have made us susceptable to the attacks and scandals about which we now so obliviously ask, "How could that have happened?" Why is anyone surprised that Worldcom BALD FACED lied about its earnings to the American people? They took their cue from their CEO's good buddy - Bill Clinton! And why is anybody surprised that the venerable Martha Stewart received illegal inside information from an almost entirely democratic run company - Imclone? That's how liberals/democrats operate. They say they're for the little guy when it comes to YOUR money. But when it's their money on the line...well as Martha's little adventure proves...they are for anyone BUT the little guy. Ann captures the essence of the hateful caustic nature of liberals values and throws them back in their ugly face. And it makes such a nice juxtopostion to Ann's face. She is DEFINITELY A HOTTIE! (Don't worry liberals, you have your own poster girls - Janet Reno, Madeline Albright and Hillary Clinton!) This book is filled with hilarious exposes on how liberals really think and shows that, in large numbers, they really do hate (amongst other things) God and country. Plus, it's just so refreshing to read a book filled with FACTS and not just touchy-feely mush minded sentiments about how things OUGHT to be. If you are a conservative, I guarantee this book will bring tears of joy to you. If you are a liberal...it will also bring tears to you. Ann Coulter...the one person who can unite both liberals and conservatives into a shared moment with the writing of a single book. God bless her.
A1M4QFOOEX3WOH	December 22, 2002	1.0	What is with this woman? If she isnt lying about her age, she's lying about alleged lies told by somebody else. Lets hope the bulimic bonerack made enough jack to keep her in whiskey and smokes until her next pack of unfunny lies flushes into the publishing sewer system.
A1OBPHRXHZF8P6	June 29, 2002	1.0	Once again, Ann Coulter attempts to provide justification for her world view using manipulated facts and outright lies...to interestingly enough, complain that mainstream media engages in the very same practices.  If the right looks bad to mainstream America, they have only their own reccord and actions to blame. From lynching laws to the attack on social security and equal pay, the conservative movement has historically been on the wrong side of public policy issues.   The American Left could not have done as good a job as the right wing itself in proving how mean spirited, shortsighted, unrealistic and irresponsible the conservative movement really is for America. Indeed, the truth speaks for itself.   That Coulter would feverishly attempt to rebut fact through the frenzied treatise indicates she is also aware of the reality, and is trying to ignore it through a profound case of projection.
A1ODZ7SDUPEGNK	December 13, 2002	5.0	After reading several dozen of the more critical reviews of Slander, it is obvious that many of those who dislike the book and its author never actually read it and posted a review with the sole intent of hurling invective at the author. If one already hates the author and despises her ideas, then he/she is not likely to waste several hours reading a book with which disagreement is a foregone conclusion. Yes, Ann Coulter is controversial and she can be polarizing. I have seen her on TV and after reading Slander, I can tell you she is far more articulate and less excitable in print than she is in a discussion. Here she really spells out so many instances of bias against even mildly conservative thinkers and ideas by the mainstream media that every thinking person has to sit back and say that she is so right. That doesn't mean liberals should not gloat about it. If I were liberal, I would be quite satisfied with the media's demonization of things conservative, and I would recognize and even revel in the anti-conservative bias of nearly every major media outlet. Coulter says little new to those of us who recognize bias on a daily basis, but she has a lot to say to those fair-minded liberals and moderates who never really had the occasion to think about how the American people are basically fed managed, scripted news stories designed to provoke certain emotions. She tells us who, where, when and why and provides copious footnotes to document her charges against those deemed guilty. I highly recommend Slander to anyone interested in politics, particularly to the non-conservative who can by reading the book get a better grasp of why conservatives appear to be angered by media bias against them.
A1QJHZUUMKZYZG	September 9, 2003	1.0	I have no problem with people taking another side to task, but have some class about it. The times when Ann tries to be funny in this, she falls flat on her face and look like the idiot she is. No wonder Republicans are moving away from her. Plus she makes dumb comments...she has been quoted as saying she wants to do away with the Emancipation Proclamation. Now, let me remind you that this was a REPUBLICAN agenda (Lincoln). See how dumb this woman is?!! Anybody who gives this book more than one star need to have their heads examine.
A1U0HC6Z37DUZ0	August 2, 2003	4.0	Ann Coulter has given us a book that describes, in detail, how the left continues to do nothing but lie about the American right, and not only how they continue to get away with it, but how they also, on occasion, actually convince a person or two that they are telling the truth.  Ann makes the point that liberals can only argue on a 6th grade level, which inevitably leads them to their ultimate in logic and persuasion...."you're stupid".  The only thing Ann got wrong in this book, is her statement that liberals don't read books.  One quick glance at all the negative reviews of this particular book resoundingly refutes that statement, and I thank all the liberals out there who actually took the time to read it.  The fact that you bothered to read the views of the "enemy" indicates a certain level of maturity on your part that has yet to be attained by most of your peers.
A1UYUM63MD9PET	January 2, 2003	5.0	Examining most of the obviously liberal reviews of the book (those with one star) on this site and one finds evidence of what Slander is about: the gross use of ad hominem attacks (e.g. she's called mentally ill and  anorexic), generalizations and (liberal) epithets (e.g. far right-wing, extremist) by liberals when demonizing conservatives--and a lack of any sort of substantive engagement with the ideas presented by conservatives. The more things change... Anyhow--good read, recommended.
A1W3NKTPJVZOC9	January 7, 2003	5.0	Hey, give this gal a microphone and let her rip.  And this ain't even the whole story. To see what a great job American business is doing of putting the world to rights you just GOTTA read "Fast Food Nation" by Eric Schlosser - and why not grab yourself a Big Mac, fries and Coke to keep your energy up while your at it.  They're the best!
A1YWBZ2GXECY4F	November 2, 2002	4.0	In her most recent work SLANDER, Ann Coulter performs a wonderful exegetical job regarding the liberal media and their control over the political realm today.  Using numerous footnotes to back up her claims, Coulter convinces one of the illogical, slanderous name-calling that modern liberals have been guilty of for the past fifty years. And yet, there are a couple of things I simply cannot get over.  Ms. Coulter, though well-meaning, is a wonderful example of how a well-meaning intellect can go terribly wrong.  To those who have no background in logic (and I pity you), Ms. Coulter commits the logical fallacy known as "poisoning the well."  She delves into the name-calling of which she accuses liberals.  Though her book contains much logically valid argumentation, Ms. Coulter could do well to drop this liberal style of fallacy.  Ms. Coulter also employs a fallacy known as the "red herring" fallacy; she would do better to drop the attacks on the intelligence of moderate (aka liberal) Republicans and the entire op-ed staff of the New York Times. Other than these two minor discrepancies, this book is a wonderful read and can be knocked out in a weekend.  I highly recommend it to my conservative bedfellows.  Her book seems to embody what a friend of mine said: "It's not so much that I'm pro-Republican, it's that I'm anti-liberal."
A1ZDL3WT7BXD3F	July 16, 2002	5.0	Ann Coulter, the wild she-stallion of the American right, is kicking down doors all over town.  And man, does she make me laugh. But like De Niro's Al Capone in the Untouchables says, "we laugh because it's funny and we laugh because it's true." The book's title is a bit misleading, in that it makes the book sound like a critique of media bias.  Rather, it's about how the left argues.  Or rather, how the left doesn't argue.  Instead of arguing, the left labels its friends moderates and its enemies both extremists and stupid and attempts to stifle free speech in media it does not control. Coulter lays out her case with devastating wit and with numerous illuminating examples from recent history, such as the Clinton impeachment, the 2000 election debacle, the nomination of John Ashcroft for Attorney General and the rise of such alternative media icons as Rush Limbaugh and Matt Drudge. If you don't like Ann Coulter, this book won't make you like her any more.  But if you're fed up with the anti-thought, pompous antics of leftist rhetoric, read _Slander_.  Speaking truth to power was never so funny.
A20UFOPYGGHHZ	October 3, 2003	1.0	repeat after me you right -wing idiots there is no liberal media, ann coulter has the brain of a peanut and start thinking for yourselves . now go watch fox news and fry the remaining lack of brain power hearing limbaugh.
A22UWADLC6BVOE	July 9, 2002	1.0	Yes, just what the world needs -- someone else convincing all of us that if we classify people by groups we are justified in hating them without ever having known them.  Bravo! Oh, I could write a ton about what I think of this type of dumb rhetoric, but I think an author ten times better than Ann said it better: "If you think an entire social class did something stupid, you're being stupid."  --Steven Brust
A24KPRUN1JADDQ	October 13, 2002	1.0	Anyone who pays full price for this book is nuts. If you MUST buy an Anne Coulter book, just wait a few months and you can pick up a nice remaindered copy from your local bargain basement trash bin for just a few bucks. That's because the intrinsic value of books like this is very low. In terms of literary merit, is there a less than one star rating?! Be forewarned: nothing good or uplifting or truly illuminating has ever come from the pen of AC. On page after page, all we see is a woman more smitten with her own bile and cleverness than a genuine interest in balanced reporting. Liberals dis the American Right. Gosh Ann, what a perfectly obvious subject for tiny minds like yours to pursue.

A24V072H7IR6Y1	November 30, 2002	5.0	As a fiscal conservative, many books - whether liberal or conservative become personal crusades, or light weight, resume-building endeavors. THIS IS NEITHER.  This book is the most well-documented, concise reading of what is really happening in America.  The only partisan book I can strongly reccommend.  Wich I had written it!
A27M94VLNMBYGE	May 23, 2003	4.0	If you want the most documented record of media bias, look no further because you have found it. Ann Coulter is a conservative talking head for cable news shows, and though she has a background in law, I'm glad she isn't a lawyer. She'd be thrown out of court! She makes a solid case, but the invective in these pages would have had her thrown out of any courtroom in America.  In fact, when the New York Times called her on a single error in her book, she was able to tell her editor that it's good news. It means the rest of it's right!  This book was a joyful read, since I was able to simply accept the fact that Ann is a hypocrite. That's right, a hypocrite. This well written and easy to follow book is chock full of personal attacks on liberals, from questioning the qauntity of brain cells in the heads of liberals to actually commenting on the 'ugliness' of this or that liberal female. This kind of banal diatribe would be enough to turn me away, but her facts ARE utterly undeniable. Believe me, they've tried to prove her wrong. They failed, making this book a must-read. Enjoy!
A29QZZUCOZQSAS	July 8, 2002	5.0	Miss Coulter is one of my new favorite columnists and television personas.  She is part of the new breed that will scream and yell louder than the liberal elite.  As to her latest book: The first thing I noticed is that Slander is incredibly well-documented.  Almost every line is cited and she clearly states how she arrived at her information sources (i.e. LexisNexis, etc.)  At times, this can be somewhat tiresome, because it seems for certain sections that we are reading just fact after fact without any opinion.  However, it does solidify her opinions even more because she provides so much backup to her points. In regard to the writing style, Miss Coulter has a sense of humor.  She is sarcastic and funny.  She uses real life quotes to draw out the humor as opposed to trying to make funny points in her own words.  I fin dthe book an extremely entertaining read. In terms of content, the book doesn't exactly cover any "new" ground although it does a very good job of solidifying some previously made points.  She discusses media bias, the liberal methods of attack, the 2000 election, the rise of the conservative news, and liberal trends throughout history.  She makes clear points that will be revered by conservatives and disparaged by liberals. Miss Coulter does not hide her dislike of the liberal attitudes, mindsets, and agenda and she attacks.  If you are looking for someone to provide both sides and present a logical, comparative argument then this book is not for you.  If you want a straight opinion piece backed up with numerous examples, written in a brash and entertaining fashion, then this book will be for you.  Enjoy, I did.
A2A6GWP1ADFEQ7	June 28, 2002	1.0	Along with the denizens of Barnum's museum and the tales of Edgar Allan Poe, Americans never tire of freak shows and horror stories.  One of the favorite horror stories on the right is the myth of the liberal media.  This myth works in the following manner, despite the fact that most of the media outlets are owned by large corporations who use these outlets to feather their nests (look at all the Disney tie ins on ABC for example), somehow the onair talent and writers apparently have free reign to determine content and pursue a political agenda as independent actors.  Even though this is at odds with the practices of any other profession, job or career in the world.  The myth of the liberal media came about in the days of Richard Nixon because Nixon could not fascinate like the Kennedys.  Rather than focus on the personal, Nixon saw this as a "vast left wing conspiracy" and such one of the treasured myths of late 20th century politics was born.  This lie has been a convenient one for the Republican party, which despite (what they would have one believe) an unending stream of left wing propaganda, they seem to have done remarkably well in politics (controlling 2 1/2 branches of government aint chicken feed).  Despite the complete lack of liberal voices (as opposed to Democratic party hacks who seem chosen for their stupidity) on radio and TV, the conspiracy industry, like old man river, just keeeps rolling along.  Ms. Coulter is only the latest to take up this well-worn flag and to fly it.  In doing so, she indulges in the hyperbolic language so common to right wing commentators who are paid from a variety of sources to sound indignent. Will we one day see a David Brock-style confession from her at some point when she has the falling out with the people that underwrite these efforts?  One can only wonder.  The people who really have a right to be annoyed are the electorate who are routinely fed pablum by both parties who find it easier to go negative than to actually explain positions to the electorate (these positions are all to often shaped not by philisophical stances, but by servicing constituents whose views frequently clash with the best interests of the nation and the best interests of the people who live in it).  If someone wishes to learn the real truth about American politics, don't read this book by Ann Coulter, pick up a copy of Democracy by Henry Adams.  It may be set in the 1870s, but the comings and goings of his senators and congressmen are all startlingly familar to anyone who reads the newspapers.
A2C0TT0XH8WFK6	June 27, 2002	5.0	Annie tells it the way it is and the truth is really upsetting the liberals who gave us the wow reviews on moores' stupid book.  Anne is a constitutional lawyer, studied the Clinton administration and has written several books other than this one.   This book points out point by point the bias that exists in all of the media, done by innuendo, ad hominem attacks, flat out name calling.  Buy it, you won't regret it.  You will never watch the alphabet networks the same way again.  Her pointing out the blathering Rather confessing he loves Hilary and Bill is worth the price.
A2FOIHXARTRQ47	June 26, 2002	5.0	Ms. Coulter's book is a well thought out, logical, even handed display of what it means to be a true American.  Finally a voice that is not afraid to say "We are right and you are stupid and evil".
A2GGUMHSML23XP	July 1, 2002	1.0	The last two reviews I have written have been critical of blowhard, drivelous conservatives such as Frau Coulter, and have not been posted.  Is this a deliberate pattern?  Have the conservatives so cowed you that you are afraid to let criticism be aired uncensored?
A2IMQ02FLQ9PME	December 20, 2002	1.0	The first paragraph of this book: "Political 'debate' in this country is insufferable. Whether conducted in Congress, on the political talk shows, or played out at dinners and cocktail parties, politics is a nasty sport. At the risk of giving away the ending: It's all the liberals' fault." Is she being ironic here? Or not? I don't get it. If you call American political debate "insufferable" in the first sentence, call politics "nasty" in the second sentence, and then make an incredibly inflammatory, insufferable and nasty comment in the third, are you a hypocrite? Or some kind of crazy genius?  Was this intentional?
A2IV1BPPITOG9O	June 22, 2003	4.0	First, let me admit something:  I have always considered myself a liberal, though recently, my identification as such has been wavering.  If you're like me, and have long suspected that there was something "not right" about politics in this country that you couldn't quite put your finger on, this is the book that will identify it for you.   The single most important claim that Ann puts forth in this book in regards to American politics is that the "conservative Christian" has become America's Emmanuel Goldstein, that state-sanctioned scapegoat from Orwell's 1984.  Her analysis, in this regard, is dead-on and everyone interested in improving this nation ought to be grateful to her for it.   In fact, one of Ann's strengths as a political thinker may well be her psychological insight.  She is right to state that when liberals "refuse to condemn what societies have condemned for thousands of years-- e.g., promiscuity, divorce, illegitimacy, homosexuality [... ...] the normal human instinct to condemn something bubbles up against a legion of quite modern vices, such as smoking, fur, red meat, excessive consumption, and land development."  In my opinion, this goes a long way in explaining the fanaticism with which liberals embrace such fringe causes.  She is also right in analyzing the appeal of modern liberalism as one of snobbery.  Having just graduated from a liberal University, I can attest to the fact that the best way into the "in-crowd" was to openly revile Dubya, the military, and "organized religion" (except Islam) while repeating feminist slogans.       There are two disappointments in this book.  The first is that  Ann doesn't follow her own logic to the inevitable conclusion regarding abortion.  She appears to oppose abortion, though she doesn't come right out and say it, which she sees as killing for the sake of convenience.  She also states, in the beginning, that those who oppose Abolitionism were "pro-choice" about slavery- a welcome reference to the fact that the pro-slavery section of this country once smeared Abolitionists as being "anti-choice" in the exact same way that "pro-choicers" smear pro-lifers today.  But I was waiting for her to note the blatant hypocrisy of liberals who take credit for the extension of human rights to African Americans while preventing the same extension to the last legally oppressed minority group in the nation: the unborn.   The second disappointment is Ann's sycophancy.  No one doubts that Bush is treated unfairly by the media, or that Reagan was before him.  But there is a reason why Reagan was called the "Great Communicator" and why Bush will never earn that title.   All in all, however, an excellent book.
A2K5VQV3F7HPBT	July 17, 2002	5.0	You have to buy this book.  Ms. Coulter has pulled the wool off and the zippers down on just about every liberal celebrity (excuse the redundancy), elected official and publication you can name.  And name them she does and does it with a style that will have you either laughing out loud or screaming "foul". Example: A popular hollywood actor said on the television program "Politically Incorrect" that George W. Bush is "stupid".  Ms. Coulter points out that the "stupid" Mr. Bush is a graduate of Yale and the Harvard Busines School while the actor never attended college because he flunked his entrance exam!  Who is the actor? Buy the book. It is the New York Times more than any other publication that falls under the sights of Ms. Coulter's withering fire. In example after example she points out the mean spirited, holier-than-thou hypicrosy of the Times and does it by quoting their own editorials and "news" articles. It's a good thing hate speech is not a hate crime or the entire editoral staff of the Times would be in Attica. Ms. Coulter backs up her attacks with 35 pages of footnotes.  If Teddy or Martin or Keith or Hillary say, "I never said that" they will also have to explain away the documentation that proves they did.  Instead of the liberals being able to to spout pious indignation they will be running red faced for cover. Simply put "Slander" is one heck of a read.  Ann Coulter is witty and very funny but more importantly her book rings with objective truth.  It is sure to be a "surprising" best seller.
A2LL3KMXB17PQP	January 1, 2003	4.0	I found Ann H. Coulter's book "Slander" to be an engrossing read (though at times a little repetitive).  This book is a nice afternoon read that is polemic and straight-foward.  She basically points out that the mainstream media is largely liberal and often holds a conservatives to a differnt standard when reporting and arguing than they hold liberals. She is hardest on the New york Times, the broadcats media and Time magazine.  She is correct that more often than not, liberals attack ad hominen more than they attack the argument or assertions.  One example that most are familar with is the Hillary Clinton's "vast right-wing conspirisy" remark on the "Today Show."  Her assertion that the mainstream media uses trigger words such as "Religious Right" to conjur up images of "narrow minded" peoiple is something we don't have to check her footnotes on, because we have heard it for ourselves and when I was a liberal, I often used the same tactics. I was brought up a liberal and until I was 36, was an adovcate for every major liberal position from abortion to homosexual unions.  But in 1996, I then noticed what Ann Coulter now reports in her book, the distortion and over-exaggeration of conservatives by the left.  Finally, I met conservatives who were not the demons I was told they were.  I then listen to their arguments for their positions and found that after all the arguments are presented and "straw men" dismantled, that I must bow to the evidence of reason and not propaganda.
A2NDTUHIH6WVR0	October 11, 2002	1.0	When you come right down to it, despite all of Ann Coulter's standard simplistic right-wing hyperbole that the "liberals have been wrong about everything in the last half century," it really is about the economy, stupid.   Without wading deeply into her pool of shallow distortions, some of which other reviewers have detailed here, what Coulter and her fellow reactionaries currently located primarily in the Republican Party don't understand (or refuse to publicly acknowledge) is that "the liberals," with their pump priming (and associated civil reforms), temporarily saved the economic system for the capitalists from more fundamental socioeconomic change when the overheated laissez-faire market of the 1920s crashed and burned.  (Hardly an original observation on my part.)  But then, she did specify "the last half century."  In that case, look where more than two decades of bipartisan "deregulation" and "privatization" by neoliberal "New Democrats" and far-right Republican "free market" cultists alike have gotten us: a kleptocratic corporate culture built on insider trading and cooked books.  (And this, by the way, is the basic economic model that US policymakers seek to impose on the entire world, via unfair and undemocratic trade agreements, at the point of a boycott or a bomb!)  And I suppose the liberals alone are to blame for Enron employees losing their pension plans, not to mention Wal-Mart workers being locked in and forced to work overtime at no pay.  But somehow, I don't think that's what the de-slanderer has in mind.   However, if Coulter and her ideological cohorts want to clear the political field of what nominal mainstream liberals remain, go right ahead.  Ultimately, the failure of US "liberalism" (or more properly, social-democratic reformism of a sort) is really the failure of capitalism to meet the needs of all the citizens in a world where the growing disparity between rich and poor -- within and between nations -- poses the single greatest threat to peace and security.   Strange, though, how Coulter and other political celebrities on the rarefied fringes of the extreme right avoid serious debate with authentic leftists.  Well, maybe not so strange, preferring as they do to engage in hackneyed diatribes against liberal straw men -- paradoxically, in a mass media these self-styled conservatives continually condemn as being run by the hated liberals, who, by their nature, would have to prefer "invective to engagement."  Unlike Ann Coulter, of course, "if only conservatives had had total control over every major means of news dissemination for a quarter century," this being her ridiculous lament, perhaps hoping that if she makes enough outrageous assertions sound like self-evident truths, maybe some will stick. But reality intrudes into the lives of everyday people.  And just as a wise old Republican observed that you can't fool all of the people all of the time, outside of Coulter's hard-right claque, nobody will be fooled by this volume either.
A2NNMFRM9LIUIB	June 26, 2003	5.0	Coulter once again takes pen in hand and impales the political left on their own words. In light of the disgraceful fall of the New York Times editorial staff for persistently shoddy journalism, Coulter appears to be almost prophetic. Probably the best line in the book is the terse observation that: "Liberals argue by creating semantic bedlam." Anyone who has had the misfortune of having to argue anything with a liberal knows the truth of that simple statement. The American public has grown tired of liberal hectoring and screaming. This well written and eminently readable books is a good antidote to the poison put out by the main scream media. A must read!
A2QFPPDDNWMKK7	October 31, 2002	1.0	No, Coulter's Slander isn't just an exercise in liberal bashing...although she engages in her fair share.  Rather this tome is a marvelous exercise in contradiction and (dare I say it?) "liberal" use of facts to back up Coulter's thesis that the majority of conservatives are good and the majority of liberals are beyond bad and more like borderline evil. Her selective use of quotes, footnotes and the ever-present Lexus Nexus search has been well documented throughout the Internet.  To say the least, "Slander" twists words out of context like a birthday party clown manipulates ordinary balloons into animal hats.  She gets facts wrong (Jesse Jackson, Jr. never had a television show in Chicago, Dale Ernhardt's death was reported on the front page of the NY Times, etc, etc.), and copiously engages in the same sort of name calling that she claims "liberals" rely on to win arguements. Here's a new angle on objections to Coulter's diatribe. She staunchly defends the Christian Right, particularly Jerry Falwell.  Coulter doesn't quote the much-repeated Falwell/Pat Robertson exchange after 9/11 (wherein they suggested the attack on the Twin Towers was divine punishment on America for homosexuality, abortions, feminists, and the ACLU among others).  Rather she quotes Walter Cronkite's reaction to to Falwell's remarks and claims this is a typical liberal reaction by an out-of-touch elitist.  So why not quote Falwell to counterpoint Cronkite? Coulter also displays a sly anti-Semitism early in the book. While she vigorously defends the likes of Falwell and Robertson all the the book, early on she bashes liberals for bashing conservatives in the wake of Matthew Shepard's murder. Here's what Coulter writes: "In another translation from the liberal rabbinate, a Washington Post columnist casually compared serious and substantial men like Shelby Steele and Clarence Thomas to a cringing, servile slave from the miniseries 'Roots' on the basis of...a 'metaphor.'"  Page 14.  That's the exact quote.  Coulter manages to defend two conservatives while cleverly linking those horrible liberals with Jewish rabbis.  Doesn't do anything like this elsewhere in the book.  An accidental or arbitrary word choice?  Coulter's too smart for that.  She's subtlely linked Jews and their learned leaders with those awful liberals, smearing the good names of good conservatives.  No accident for this fan of Falwell (who as of this writing on 10/31/02 still has a section on his website claiming that the anti-Christ will be a Jewish male.) 1 star for her ability to get this nonsense published.  It's hard to get a book published in America; Coulter's managed to hit the best seller lists with a poorly researched and ultimately polarizing tome.
A2WV8Y608V90IJ	July 13, 2002	4.0	This is a good book but you have to read it with an open mind.  Coulter points out some very interesting tactics that Liberals use.  First and foremost, did you notice how liberals often resort to name-calling and ad hominem attacks?  Of course you did, but Coulter offers solid documentation on how often this actually occurs.  If you read the book you will be surprised at the level of research that went into this book.  Most poli sci books like this lack any kind of serious research.  In this book, the footnotes are quite extensive.  It is impressive.
A2XOOCN6BJ0JDF	June 28, 2002	1.0	Does the far right have some need to feel persecuted? Conservatives have been calling the shots in America for the past two decades. In politics, three of the last four Presidents were conservative Republicans. Reagan succeed in making "liberal" an insult.  Clinton was hobbled by the Republican opposition, so much so that he abandoned any attempt at health care reform and ended up passing a welfare "reform" bill that any of his Democratic predecessors from FDR on would have choked on. Us liberals--oops, I mean "progressives", we don't use the "L" word any more-- were lukewarm at best towards him until the far right started its scurrilous jihad against him. In the media, Rush is still huge, O'Reilly is huge, those "Left Behind" books are huge, right-wing diatribes like Coulter's regularly make the best-seller lists, Time Magazine made George W. Bush it's Person of the Year...I tells ya, I just don't get it. Conservatives like Coulter, they're like Iranian clerics or Communist secret police or something. They want it all. No opposition. Our side gets some little crumb like "Will and Grace" or Jim Jeffords switching sides and they think they're under siege. I wish we had as much power as they think we do.
A32HH93JPN3TVV	July 18, 2002	2.0	The danger, of course, of naming a book "Slander: Liberal Lies About the American Right," as Coulter has done, is that you're inviting people to check out your own accuracy. And, unfortunately, in Coulter's case, that was a big mistake. That's why the Weekly Standard, right wing but with integrity, panned the book. Let's start with the very title. Coulter named it "Slander," but, of course, what she means when speaking about the media, whether print or electronic, is "libel." Sloppy? Just a preview of things to come. Coulter slams "liberal" newspapers for using the term "Christian right" and "religious right." She says that shows the evil of the mainstream press. But she's SO lazy that she never ran a Nexis search on the term. If she had, she'd realize that The Washington Times uses the same term all the time.  Coulter contends that Maureen Dowd attacked Tom DeLay for his religiosity in a June 20, 1999, column. In fact, the object was Al Gore. Sloppy? Par for the course. I'm not going to go into Coulter having to backpedal on her charges against Katie Couric, even on the puffball kind of interview she was subjected to on Fox's "The O'Reilly Factor" on July 11. More serious is how incredibly lazy she was in putting this book together. She laments on the hard time George W. Bush got in campaign 2000. A Nexis search for 1999 and up to the election in 2000 reveals that The New York Times had two stories mentioning Harken Energy. Gee, that was probing! No major newspaper investigated Bush's 1976 DUI conviction in Maine until a smalltown paper broke the story late in the campaign. They were just as lazy -- well, just as lazy as Coulter! Who did a story on Bush's being AWOL from his Air Guard commitment for a 17-month period in the early 1970s? Well, except for The Boston Globe, no one uttered a peep until days before the election. The "liberal" media certainly didn't put Bush under the same microscope as Bill Clinton, whose Vietnam woes surfaced early in 1992. But then the well-funded right-wing media network isn't interested in exposing Bush's faux pas. Oops! Coulter maintains that there is no Richard Scaife-funded media machine. She'll be writing that the world isn't round next. That's why she conveniently left this episode out of her book: In February 2001 at a media panel, Paul Begala noted that, on Nexis, he "found 3,641 stories about Bill Clinton 'dodging the draft' ...and there were 49 stories about Bush and the National Guard."  A lot of people think Coulter twists facts. She does, of course, counting on the fact that most people don't have access to Nexis to doublecheck her sources. But, mostly, she's too lazy to research and, therefore, relies on her own prejudices to fill out a book.  Do women get a harder time about looks in the media, as Coulter contends? Of course, they do. But it's been N.O.W. and Ms. who make that point -- not the Independent Women's Forum that gave Coulter her start. Funded by none other than that non-existent right-wing conspiracy.
A32IR1P21W9TH0	April 29, 2003	1.0	In her book Slander, Ann Coulter portrays all contemporary political discourse in America as "insufferable" and "a nasty sport."  The responsibility for this, she alleges, lies solely with liberals.  Liberals are "bitter and angry," they "hate America" with "a species of primitive religious hatred."  Their "idea of political debate" is "ad hominem attack," and a "central component" of their "hate speech is to make paranoid accusations based on their own neurotic impulses."  Intriguingly enough, though, the more Coulter describes liberals as hate-filled, bitter and neurotic, the more they come off sounding remarkably like Ann Coulter. Coulter's cartoonish Manichaeanism might be easier to take if it was supported by rational argument, but Coulter is to rational argument what Jackson Pollock was to painting - she just splatters invective in all directions and hopes that some of it hits the canvas.  She does score an occasional hit (after all, as Gibbon once put it, "faction exaggerates, rather than invents"): her description of how serial tongue-prober Bob Packwood was depicted by the press before and after his fall from power has the ring of truth about it.  And her advocacy of Phyllis Schlafly as an unjustly neglected intellectual is an intriguingly heterodox position which makes me want to see if Schlafly really is the towering intellect that Coulter depicts. Coulter's own prose style is serviceable without being flashy.  She uses the term "hoi polloi" correctly more than once, which always impresses me.  But she repeats points over and over again, as if she believes that her ideal reader is a mental defective with a short attention span who needs to be hit over the head several times before they get the point.  It's not enough for Coulter to claim that Ronald Reagan "won the Cold War" (a dubious enough assertion in any event) - she has to say it eight times.  She is also addicted to the word "starlet," which she tosses around like Hedda Hopper in her heyday (at one point four times on the same page).  Her contempt for women who are more attractive than she is knows no bounds, and one gets the feeling that Coulter thinks that a person should lose all right to express themselves politically once they've received a SAG card (Charlton Heston, I suppose, would get an exemption). Ironically, Coulter reveals less of herself and her opinions when she bellows than when she attempts to understate, as when she refers to the Wall Street Journal as a "conservative" - in quotes - newspaper, or when she posits that "Fox News may modulate slightly to the right" (she also refers to Washington Times writer Tony Blankley as "telegenic," at which point we enter the realm of science fiction). Coulter in her endless interviews, when she's not bemoaning the fact that Timothy McVeigh didn't blow up the New York Times instead of the Murrah Building, tends to take great pride in the fact that her book has oodles of footnotes when in fact it has none (she is to be congratulated, however, for having made it through law school without learning the difference between a footnote and an endnote).  Her endnotes are revealing, however.  The number of actual books read and cited is depressingly skimpy - most of what evidence Coulter has accumulated has come from trolling through the electronic database Lexis/Nexis - which, incidentally, is too expensive to be accessed by the general public.  I suppose it could be a coincidence that Coulter has seen to it than none of her readers will be able to check up on her references unless they're in what conservatives refer to suspiciously as the "mainstream media," but I tend to doubt it.            She pours disdain on liberals who referred to Ronald Reagan during the 1980s as "dumb," in spite of the fact that Norman Podhoretz left his first meeting with Reagan "wondering whether he had any brains at all" (the quote can be found on page 618 of Stephen F. Hayward's book The Age of Reagan).  She condemns former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara for "losing" the Vietnam War (which ended seven years after he left the government) and "condemning millions of people to live under a communist tyranny," when a celebrated Republican president did exactly the same thing.  Coulter states that "Truman got the country into a war in Korea, and couldn't get us out for two and a half years.  Eisenhower was elected and ended the war in six months."  The fact is that Truman, when faced with Communist aggression, went to the UN and assembled a multinational coalition to stop that aggression - actions that conservatives tend to approve of, so long as they're being done by a Republican whose surname is Bush.  Eisenhower, on the other hand, was so anxious to bug out of Korea that he blackmailed South Korea's President into acquiescing to a stalemate that handed half his country over to the Communists by threatening to withdraw all American troops immediately if he didn't accept the truce.  As a result the war never officially ended, 37,000 American troops are stationed in Korea to this day, and 22,000,000 people (North Korea's current population), are, as Coulter put it when discussing Robert McNamara, condemned "to live under a Communist tyranny."  Even Stephen Ambrose admits that, had President Truman tried to end the war under the same terms, the Republicans in Congress would have tried to impeach him.      To quote that well-known Freudian Peggy Noonan in her most recent book on Ronald Reagan, "A lot of people have a way of projecting their own flaws, their own sins, onto others.  They see in others the transgressions they themselves routinely commit."  The more you read Slander, the more it becomes obvious that Coulter's book is nothing more or less than a 256-page-long exercise in projection, and in the final analysis, her career is nothing more than conclusive proof of how far you can go in this country with a maximum of self-promotion and a minimum of class.
A34KZYE51A0A19	July 13, 2002	4.0	Coulter's "Slander" is enough to anger any conservative. She outlines the wide array of lies, insults, labels and venom that have been directed at conservatives and their leaders. Many of Coulter's topics will sound very familiar: the media's protection of Al Gore before, during, and after the 2000 campaign vs. the relentless (and baseless) concerns about Bush's intelligence; Reagan's accomplishments vs. the media's concern with, you guessed it, his intelligence; how conservative books, at least to the media, are always "surprise" best sellers, while liberal themed books tend to bomb at the cash register, etc.  The main fault with this book is that Coulter spends too much time on the "religious right" and not enough time on the venom directed to Pro-Lifers. In all fairness, the religious right (a meaningless label really, and used pejoritively) is regularly maligned and labeled for their values and religion, but one wonders if such a lengthy discussion was necessary. Coulter concludes with some discussion on abortion, but not nearly enough to do the topic justice. Surely she is aware of the media's insistence to use the negative label "anti-abortion" rather than "pro-life" and she must know that Pro-Life incidents of clinic vandalism and bombings are overblown in proportion while violence by Pro-Choicers against Lifers (praying rosaries, no less) is completely ignored. Coulter may have been in a rush to publish this one, but nonetheless, it's a necessary discussion on the visicous misrepresentations and arrogance within the media in attacking anything outside the liberal ideology. And they call conservatives "intolerant"?
A36MEL70EEFBFS	December 31, 2002	5.0	Ann Coulter tells it like it is when it comes to the socio-political environment in America today.  Since the left no longer has a stranglehold on disseminating information today, with the Internet, talk radio, & FoxNews, people like Ann Coulter and Michele Malkin finally have a voice.  Ann Coulter documents case-by-case the bias and outright lies against the American right by the American left (which by definition includes the mainstream media outlets).  If you like Ann Coulter's syndicated columns (on Yahoo or Townhall.com) you'll love this book.
A37Z8SVYCOFEQ3	September 27, 2002	4.0	Ann Coulter does an absolutely magnificent job of not just saying the emperor has no clothes - she names his tailors! Even the most ardent liberal cannot deny the juxtapositions Ann exposes.  Her examples are clear - there is very little gray. My only criticism is that, like many writers, Ann tries to fit in as many multi-syllabic words as will help the writer take on an intellectual tone.  She doesn't need it. Otherwise, a powerful and entertaining book to read.  I liked it much better than Bernard Goldberg's "Bias".
A39AKB7OM66L44	June 26, 2002	5.0	One word comes to mind to describe Ann Coulter's writing style: pithy.  This book successfully describes in brilliant detail the day-to-day numbing of public opinion by a few powerful media types in New York City that control all of the news we as citizens receive and govern our lives by. I agree completely with her analysis of the NY Times as a bastion of left-wing reactionism, and outright hatred for the current President Bush. For example, terms like "enormous Bush tax cut that caused the deficits we now face..." that isn't news, that's commentary! Yet the Times will say that in their straight stories, not the editorials only. Her take on Katie Couric and the Today show is right on the money, how they, in their own perky morning way, try and slant stories towards a Leftist point of view time and time again. A work like this is especially important now, when our country faces the imminent threat of attack and we are relying on the media to give us the straight story and not advance a political agenda or try and pull down our President. Hopefully, this will have the effect of raising the awareness of enough people in this country to realize we shouldn't just accept the gutless reactionism of left-wing media types. Go get 'em Ann!!!!
A3AUL23GMCOP2A	August 20, 2002	4.0	Ann Coulter's central thesis is that "the impossibility of having any sort of productive dialogue [with Leftists] about civic affairs has become an immovable reality" (p. 8). Though it's hardly unusual to hear a conservative charge that the Left dominates most media outlets, she nevertheless makes a compelling, and impassioned, case. The argument itself could probably have been made in four pages. The other 240 or so are exhaustive evidence (be sure to read the footnotes!) Most interesting to me were her discussions of the huge sales success of conservative books, in spite of their being boycotted by the "mainstream" media, and her analysis of the Left's frenzied attacks on their favorite, though, she argues, non-existent, whipping-boy, the "religious right." By the end of the book, it's very clear that critics who charge Miss Coulter with hypocrisy for name-calling while accusing Leftists of name-calling have missed the central point she's trying to make. For her, the peppery characterization or zingy one-liner is a rhetorical device. For the Left, it's all they have: "Liberals don't try to win arguments, they seek to destroy their opponents and silence dissident opinions" (p. 91). While she has the diagnosis nailed, though, the weakness of this book is that the author fails to give us a prescription for dealing with it. She offers a suggestion ("As a start, one would have to cut out public schools, colleges, the evening news, sitcoms, movies, children's cartoons, book reviews, Lifetime: TV for Women, Katie Couric, Bryant Gumbel, People magazine, Vanity Fair, the New York Times, Time, Newsweek, and, indeed, all major newspapers and magazines" [pp. 116-7]), but never explains why she seems unwilling to go this route.  A large-scale Hoppean "strategy of personal secession" (Hans-Hermann Hoppe, "Democracy: The God that Failed," Transaction, 2001) would seem to be just the ticket for leaving the Left nobody but themselves to talk to. In sum, "Slander" shows Ann Coulter has her mind around the essential problem. Now she needs to tell us what she would have the American Right do about the situation she so ably, and passionately, describes.
A3CYDHL8RCOK6K	June 25, 2002	5.0	Ever notice how TV Talk Show Hosts are dependent upon Earphones to think and ask questions? And they still cannot ask the right questions to liberal politicians at the right time? Finally, a book that points out how weak our media elite has spiral into de-evolution. The book will undoubtedly cause a commotion among the dying media privileged. For it shows how they have disparage others over the years to grovel favor not from the masses but from their bosses. I do not always agree with all of Ann Coulter's views, but I am thankful for her courage to speak out and respect her very much. The author points out how American leading media institutions actually use propaganda tactics in labeling anyone who advocates common sense approaches to serious public interest subjects. Coulter modus operandi is to take on left wing cynics with sound arguments to enlighten their stone wall empty minds of media's' misinformation mush.  The liberal left media is faced with a serious problem when it actually goes into topics they cannot understand and revert to using fascist tactics under the disguise of multiculturalism. This identity politics mixing is used effectively by communists who often blend a little truth into falsehoods that in the end confuses the real issues at hand for egotistical power reasons. The media need not be left or right, just candid with both views and quit disrespecting people advocating the conservative side that uses facts over fiction! In this book, she is challenging the media's laissez-faire witch-hunting mentality to be thoughtful, accountable, and straightforward about problems they often buildup and never resolve for self-interested purposes. It is time to end the race baiting mocking sticky tag towards conservatives so a proper public debate can take place on all subject matter under discussion. The media finds Ann Coulter fear provoking because she is well educated, not afraid of genuineness and is more attractive than most liberal TV personalities who often lack the brains for any substantive dialogue. Ann Coulter earn an education at Cornell University and the University of Michigan Law School. She went on to be a Law Clerk for Court of Appeals, Legal Counsel on Senate Judiciary Committee, and an Attorney for the Department of Justice. Even the late publisher Katherine Graham cannot match those kinds of qualifications. Now when you compare Ann Coulter's credentials to Katie Courics, Maureen Dowd, Gloria Steinem, Dan Rather, Arthur Sulzberger and Howell Raines, one can see why few of them could ever take her on without an earphone and even with it cannot humiliate her. What the writer is advocating is that the American Media elite deserves being scrutinized due to the hiring of incompetent fashion models and newsreaders that cannot think of a decent question for a liberal politician. They have created a world of star obsessed people over an educational electorate. In the end, they have contributed to their own demise when the very people they choose to influence no longer values the news because of its bias. The public needs an Investigative TV Show that follow our own media darlings around and report on who they are dating, cheating with, or have covered up for their own benefit. And see how many "No Comments" of their lack of education and knowledge they would have to address. All the writer did in this book is depict reality and everyone in media is shocked that they have been ensnared in scornful name calling for years. If Coulter is wrong, each can file a lawsuit for slander or libel against her. Go ahead and make her day, but truth is an absolute defense against libel and slander with or without malice!  Now that the media have been trapped the only question left is what to do with them? Ann Coulter has the answer, turn them off as she turns anyone with a thinking brain on, not by her looks, but by her words of wisdom and wit merge with the facts. The perfect formulas to inoculate you against any media's mannequin reproduction dummies that crave to be advertised to sell themselves like manure in Nebraska! The public cannot smell them through their TV's but Americans know when they stink, yet remain polluting our airwaves with their ignorance! Ultimately, Ann Coulter wants what all-thoughtful people want from our media as written by Plato, Symposium 203E-204A. "None of the gods love wisdom or desire to become wise, for they are wise already -- nor if someone else is wise, do they love wisdom. Neither do the ignorant love wisdom or desire to become wise; for this is the grievous thing about ignorance, that those who are neither good nor beautiful think they are good enough, and do not desire that which they do not think they are lacking." So using typical media tactics may I say, Right Wing Radical Philosopher Aristotle often proved his tutor Plato wrong on many subjects, but agreed with Plato's commentary that cultivates knowledge over prejudice; just like Ann Coulter is doing to today's media elite by writing this book.
A3DENUJJ7EJ9KT	December 30, 2002	5.0	In this book, Coulter explains how the New York Times, Washington Post, ABC, CBS, NBC, Time, and Newsweek were for years able to decide what was news, and how it was reported (slanted.)  Now with cable news, talk radio, and the Internet, the mainstream media's control over the flow of information is slipping, but it's still formidable If you are already weary from liberal bias and moral pretensions, particularly among liberal journalists and politicians, this book can be tough to read at first. Coulter starts out in the first chapter with one example after another, each of which is enough to make your stomach churn.  It's like watching one of those graphic Driver's Ed scare films.  The only thing that gets you through it is Coulter's great wit.   Hang in there, the successive chapters cover fascinating cases of how the manipulative, liberal media try to advance agendas, and shape public opinion, with their dishonest coverage of various issues of the day.    Coulter is well suited to the task of taking on the Left because she doesn't follow their rules. For the past several decades, liberals have set the rules for political debate in such a way that conservatives can have their character questioned for merely disagreeing with the liberal position.  Disagree with a liberal about the causes or extent of homelessness and you'll be told you don't "care." A liberal can inject race (a subject not covered much in this book) into any issue, at any time.  But a conservative can't even bring up race without drawing the inevitable suggestion or charge of "racism."  Taboos are everywhere. As a result, many conservatives - other than radio talk show hosts - can tend to be overly polite or restrained in political discourse, so as not to provoke a personal attack.  Coulter, on the other hand, could care less.  She's more audacious than Rush Limbaugh.  In "Slander," Coulter treats the liberal's phony, self-serving rules and taboos with about as much etiquette as a barracuda.  She is confident enough in her positions to go after the liberals with a vengeance, and she is particularly hard on the New York Times.  Her targets have three problems. First, they have a hard time countering her on substance because she has done an extremely thorough job of researching and documenting her positions.  Second, they can't very well ignore her because her book was a No. 1 NYT Bestseller.  Third, when they respond with their usual personal, vicious attacks, it only proves her point.  She's practically egging them on.  She has truly changed the rules of the game. It's only a matter of time until somebody tries to ride her coattails to the Bestseller List with a book titled "Ann Coulter is a Little, Blonde Idiot."
A3HE9I4GQ4OXYE	March 31, 2003	2.0	The author could have easily covered all of the key points in this book in half the number of pages.  Yes, the liberals enjoy almost monopolistic control of the press.  Yes, they resort to name-calling and other childish tactics when confronted.  And yes, their party platform brings far more comparisons to commmunism than it does a free, democratically-based society.  But I found myself skipping paragraphs and sometimes whole pages because I grew tired of reading the same message over and over again. The book is also inconsistent in its use of references.  Although Ms. Coulter makes an attempt to provide factual references to backup her statements, on many occasions she fails to cite the references for her quotes.  In my opinion, this makes those quotes meaningless.  A similar, but far superior example of fact-based conservative writing is "Useful Idiots" by Mona Charen. Finally, I can't deny that the writer makes little effort to keep this book on an objective level.  She labels and uses name calling in much the same way as the people she's writing about.  If you're going to criticize someone for being juvenile and emotional you'll make a much better case if you don't use the same tactics yourself. While I myself am a strong conservative, I could not consciously use this book to defend my arguments against liberals, because it is inconsistent in the use of references and far too subjective to be taken seriously.
A3IPSECQAUAT8V	July 6, 2003	5.0	Let's face it.  If your not of a conservative mind set you probably won't like this book.  I'm a conservative.  And I LOVED this book.  Coulter's style is enormously entertaining AND illuminating.  After your finished with this book go out and get Treason - also a great book.  I just love her bare fisted take no prisoners approach.  No milquetoast she!
A3JYCVBQ5GNBO7	March 4, 2003	3.0	I must admit, I am a liberal.  However, I looked forward to reading Coulter's book to learn more about the supposed liberal bias of the media.  I found the book to have a "wining" tone.  It was a list of name callings and examples of mistreatments.  I think most of this is just public perception of conservative issues.  I'm not convinced by this book that life (people's opinions) imitates art (media).  It seems to me that the media is reporting more what the people want to hear.  Still, I am glad I read Slander and did learn alot about the negativism of politics on both sides of the fence.
A3LJTMT2WB7Y3P	June 2, 2003	3.0	I love Ann Coulter, but I thought this book was a little lackluster.  Her details and commentary are right on target, but personally I found the book to be a tad dry.  [...]
A3MUDAYXE0ANVM	July 7, 2002	4.0	I can't remember which author said it or the actual saying, but the gist was, the mark of a truly intelligent person is the ability to be able to hold two opposing views within the mind and accept the reality of both.  I don't consider myself an extreme conservatist or liberal, I lie somewhere in the middle, as do most Americans, I think.  What Ms. Coulter offers the reader in "Slander . . ." bears some consideration. A book that might cause you to look beyond your own perceptions.
A3O2RCKAMSE9X7	May 17, 2003	4.0	Ever since the Kennedy years, both conservative and liberals have been accusing each other of the very worst sort of demagoguery.  The conservative right claims that the media is slanted against it while the liberal left says much the same.  Out of all the recent books that deal with the issue of media domination, the ones that are the most convincing are written by conservatives, with SLANDER by Ann Coulter leading the way.  Her thesis differs from Bernard Goldberg's BIAS who similarly claims a media slant tilted against the right.  Goldberg describes a left wing mentality that does not view conservatism as a deliberate target of invective; rather, he sees the left as those who are indecently sure that theirs is the only political philosophy worth a red penny and that there is no need to create a cabal against a rightist viewpoint that simply does not exist as a mainsream mode of thought.  Coulter takes a harsher interpretation.  She asserts that the bias is real, it is deliberate, and it is meant to hurt.   Whenever any writer attempts to convince the reader of a media bias, it is incumbent on that writer to present a series of convincing arguments that are not taken out of context and are thoroughly documented.  This Ann Coulter has done beyond question.  She lists dozens of examples that illustrate that not only does the left engage in the very same invidious activities of which it accuses the right, but when confronted with proof positive that it has done so, it invariably lies, changes the topic, or simply ignores the incriminating evidence of its own culpability.  When Michael Bellesiles wrote ARMING AMERICA, a book that was supposed to prove that our founding fathers were not as heavily armed as the NRA insisted they were, the liberal press, headed by The New York Times, hailed Bellesiles as one who 'has dispersed the darkness that covered the gun's early history in America.'  And if our colonial forebears were not so fortified with guns, then the NRA could not claim history as a justification for the current ownership of guns.  Unfortunately for Bellesiles and The New York Times, several scholars who tried to duplicate his research discovered that Bellesiles had faked and forged nearly every bit of evidence.  And just how loudly did the liberal media trumpet Bellesiles' plagiarism?  Not a peep was heard.  Can you imagine if the reverse had happened and the Times had caught a conservative scholar playing footsie with history? What makes Coulter's arguments so convincing is that she documents her claims with hundreds of footnotes, none of which have been disproven by the left.  The unalterable conclusion of her book is that the liberal left is indeed as biased as she claims.  The next time a democrat accuses a republican of being dumb, racist, homophobic, or a member of the religious right, I would ask that democrat for the same proof that Coulter would use to prove the contrary.  I don't think that this democrat could do that, and this is why SLANDER is the stunning book that it is and why it should be read by anyone who has an interest in knowing to what our nation's media bias is.
A3PIJJ4J2DDI6Q	September 12, 2002	5.0	Ann Coulter is, without a doubt a giant among the intellectuals of the conservative movement.  In her latest novel Slanders: Liberal Lies About the American Right Miss Coulter shows the truth about not only the bias in the media against all things conservative, she also exposes their arguments and ideas for what they are:  Shallow attempts by followers of a discredited philosphy to hold on to power at all costs.   The strongest point of the book, in my opinion, is Ms. Coulter's exposure of the liberal bias in the media.  The facts are irrefutable.  Media icons such as Tim Russert, Jeff Greenfield, Crhist Matthews, Bill Moyers, Brian Williams, Rick Inderfurth, Elizabeth Brackett, Jane Pauley, Pierre Salinger, Cokie Roberts, and Maria Shriver are all either ex democratic party operatives or related to Democratic Party Icons.  Miss Coulter notes that none of this draws a single note of condemnation from the Media (of course because these people ARE the media).  How many ex Republican's are "journalists"?  Diane Sawyer, Susan Molinari (short lived) and Pat Buchanan are the only three names which come to mind.  Miss Coulter also mentions the media fire storm that occurs when a Republican becomes a member of the media while this firestorm doesn't occur when a democrat like George Stephanopalus does the same thing.   Miss Coulter's book is back up with numerous facts, and is well documented (about 100 or more footnotes per chapter).  The book is well written and the arguments are obviously those of an intellectual heavy-weight.  If you are interested in conservative thoughts and ideals this book is a must read.
A3QSGEP9WWG0LV	September 12, 2003	1.0	If you are a conservative, then you will love this book. No, not because it proves why conservatism is better than liberalism through factual evidence and debate-lik nature, but because her outrageous lies will only support your already built-in bias against liberals. Btw: Liberal - favoring progress and reform in social institutions and fullest practicable liberty of individual action.  Do you see anything wrong with that? I dont, but conservatives use this term as if it's meant to diss someone.  So if you would like to reinforce your bias with more conservative lies and distortion of truth, this book is for you.
A3RV3OSG41OQPQ	September 8, 2002	5.0	Unfortunately, the only thing I learned from this book was details about what I already knew. Anyone looking at the media and politics with an objective view can see that liberals, in general, would rather launch an attack based on falsehood and/or emotion, than debate truth.  Coulter identifies many of the lies used by the media and liberal politicans to taint the public's (aka VOTERS) views of "conservatives." The book is almost a non-stop recital of comments made by various pundits and politicians. It has also served to enforce my belief that the greatest modern dangers to our Republic are CNN, CBS, ABC, and NBC.  Indeed, Coulter seems to have little love for liberals. In the last line of the book, she describes them as "savagely cruel bigots who hate ordinary Americans and lie for sport." While I'd have to agree that that probably describes liberal POLITICANS, I don't consider that an accurate portrayal of the "middle-class liberal," who is usually simply deceived or confused.   What was a little depressing about this book was Coulter did a fantastic job pointing out the problems, but at the end of the book she presented no solution! (Is there one?)   What REALLY surprised me (though in hindsight it shouldn't have) are the invective reviews posted here by (of course) obvious liberals. They serve to prove Coulter's thesis: if you can't argue against the truth, attack the source, change the subject, and above all: deny, deny, deny.  If you like "liberal bashing," you'll probably enjoy this book. On the other hand, if you ARE a liberal, save your money and buy a Sunday newspaper for a few weeks. At least you'll enjoy the comics.
A3S5C7Y0WT2Q9N	August 19, 2002	3.0	I recall Ann Coulter's appearances on political talk shows over the years, and I remember thinking that she is an articulate, somewhat angry, and definitely in-your-face political commentator.  With her book "Slander," Ms. Coulter carries these traits into the written word.  There are some high points, including insightful descriptions of media spin and some comical portrayals of liberal policy makers.  Most politically right-leaning individuals are likely to nod in agreement with most of the arguments she makes in this, the latest of her "Bestsellers," but the level of invective is so high as to be a potential turn-off. If I were to use simple terms to summarize Ms. Coulter's stance on liberal bias, I'd choose "double standard" and "contradiction."  What she is very good at is finding examples of how the media go bonkers over Republicans' indiscretions, but play down those of Democrats.  This trait, as she posits, manifests itself in ways that involve:  1) slamming conservative ideas, and fawning over liberal ones; or 2) using derogatory generalizations to classify conservative views, and laudatory ones to classify liberal views; or 3) character assassinations of Republican candidates, and constant praise for Democrats ... and so on.  Essentially true, but you've probably heard stuff like this before.  In this book, you get over two hundred pages of numerous (around 475,000; I lost count), well-documented examples of liberally biased propaganda.  Like her or not, she's usually pretty sharp. As for me, I tend to side with Ms. Coulter on the issues put forth in her book, and I rather enjoyed the chapters that dealt with the 2000 presidential election (interesting things I hadn't heard before) and, especially, the chapter discussing the media's vacillation over whether or not the "religious right" is dead or alive.  Enlightening and funny.  Still, I had a hard time getting over the frequent, rant-stricken diatribes.  If she had left out the name-calling and condescending tone, her ideology would have come across as more intelligent and levelheaded.  Bernard Goldberg did this slightly better in "Bias."  Dennis Prager is still the one to emulate (check out "Think a Second Time"). Overall, I'd give this book a "guarded" recommendation.  The writing is strong, but the viewpoints may be unpalatable for some readers.
A3SHAOQ7FI3JLN	June 28, 2002	1.0	She doesn't need to be right. She doesn't need to be informative. She doesn't need to be fair. She doesn't need to know what she's talking about. She needs to shock people.  To call attention to herself.  To throw together a diatribe so outlandish that it will become an instant best seller (it has!) as soon as it comes to the public's attention. How do you achieve this?  It's disarmingly simple. You insult enough people in the media until they invite you onto their shows just so that they can argue with you.  Like she just did with Katie Couric,  whom she referred  to as "the affable Eva Braun of morning television" (formulated deliberately to start a fight),  resulting in the sudden skyrocketing of sales of this worthless book. And she walks away with the money, smug in the knowledge that we're all just sheep, completely under her control.  The sales figures prove that she's right about this fact, even though she's so wrong about everything else.
A3UT41TWD7N0D5	February 24, 2004	3.0	First let me begin by saying that I am what most people would label a Conservative.  Anne Coulter would probably say that the liberal media would group me in with the extreme Religious Right.  I wouldn't classify my self as such as I like to think I am still capable of voting for issues and candidates based on other things beside party affiliation.  I have admired Anne Coulter for sometime.  I first became aware of her during the impeachment process for President Clinton.  She was a frequent guest commentator on the various news networks and I found her to be quite knowledgeable about the impeachment process.  Through the years I've continued to see her on various television shows and when I heard about her book SLANDER I thought I'd give it a try. SLANDER, to it's credit, does a good job of illustrating how the media, especially the 3 major networks and leading news print media favor liberal politicians and issues.  Some of the bias displayed by these agencies is so blatant that these news agencies seem to be more of a propaganda ministry for the Liberal Left.  One of the funnier, and in reality sadder, examples in her book deals with verbal gaffs by political figures.  There are many examples of the media passing off liberal politicians gaffs as humorous, while then indicating the gaffs made by conservative politicians are themselves examples of that persons over all stupidity.  The examples provided by Coulter are all recent and most readers will be able to recall the incidents as well as recognize how they blindly accepted the media analysis of the gaffs.   Coulter does provide references and statistics for some of her examples. SLANDER, to it's discredit, is as guilty of stereotyping  and insulting Liberals as she indicates they do the Conservatives.  Coulter complains that all liberals are guilty of this and guilty of that.  Never does she mention a liberal issue or politician that has actually benefitted the U.S. or provided it a service.  She complains about the stereotyping of the rich class in the U.S. but never acknowledges that behind the stereotype there are legitimate examples of abuse and corruption.  She complains about the the race baiting that Liberals, in my opinion and hers, are guilty of.  However, she fails to even acknowledge the reason, again in my opinion, that baiting has worked is because for the last 30 years minority concerns have not been at the top of the Conservative agenda.  It is this kind of bashing and bias that Coulter has peppered throughout the entire book. Lastly, there are of course two sides to every story.  Coulter clearly comes down on one side while refusing to acknowledge the other side has any merits whatsoever.  So while I agree with most of what she has to say I was hoping for a little less of her eloquent bashing and a little more of a well rounded approach to some of her arguments.  This book will obviously appeal more to those who share Coulter's political views and will no doubt enrage  those who don't.  I'm positive this was Coulter's goal.
A3V03UX4Q7SH8X	July 15, 2002	5.0	For years the conservatives have complained about overt lying by Democrats and a media almost wholly controlled by liberals. It now appears they were correct all along. As a recovering liberal, I admit to a twinge of defensiveness as I read this book. By the time I finished it, I felt like I'd been punched in the gut. Coulter is relentless as she piles up the innuendo, twisted truths, and outright falsehoods attributed to my party - a party which has been overtaken by reactionary loud-mouths which betray the fair play and decency we once represented. The thirty-five pages of documentation is hard to deny. I don't want to read childish rants about Coulter's blond hair, short skirts, and political affiliations in college. I want to read substantive rebuttals to her claims. To this request, the silence is deafening. I know open minded Democrats exist who will read and be embarrassed by the revelations in this book. To the others I say - don't kill the messenger.
A3VABXPH5QLZ2L	July 8, 2002	5.0	It seems a great deal of the negative reviews I have seen tend to miss the point of this very enlightening book - IT IS POINTING OUT THE VENOMOUS, BLATANT BIAS OF MEDIA OUTLETS THAT CLAIM TO BE OBJECTIVE SOURCES OF CURRENT EVENTS. I always felt the left's mainstream media control is propaganda drummed up by Limbaugh and his 20 million disciples. Apparently, I was very wrong.  For those of you who say this book is not based in fact, go to LexisNexis and find out for yourself.  I have spent a few evenings checking her sources and every single one I've looked into is verifiable and is not taken out of context.  To all you Left-wingers, take it upon yourself to go there and prove me wrong (dont waste my tax dollars and lobby for a government study into non-fictional inaccuracies, take the time and do your own homework.)   And the ignorant reviews which state Ann Coulter being "the pot that called the kettle black" by slamming liberals for slamming conservatives? Did you even read the book?  Ann never claimed to be objective, and frankly that is not her job.  The problem is claiming to be something you're not, as the mainstream press does with great frequency.  I still can't believe the amount of times they refer to conservatives as "Nazi's". What planet are these people from?
A43PL1VL3BL8Y	October 8, 2002	4.0	...While I understand the need for books like this one, I'm not sure I altogether like it.  I would prefer that conservatives take the high-road and dispense with all these blistering polemics, especially when it comes to a topic as controversial and important as media bias.  Coulter's obsession with raking the liberal media over the coals for its intransigent unfairness limits her book somewhat.  Let's be honest about this: liberal bias is only one of the many sins committed by our news media.  Professional new journalists also suffer from laziness and a bias towards establishment figures.  One cannot completely understand the liberal bias of the media without discussing these other problems, because they are related.  The media's bias towards establishment figures is especially tricky, because it seems to contradict the media's bias in favor of liberalism (or so the Left would have us believe).  But this contradiction is largely apparent rather than real.  Reporters don't like going after powerful individuals in the establishment because their afraid of reprisals.  They'll criticize them often enough, because that attracts viewers.  But they will avoid the real big story -- e.g., any of the stories that could have gotten Bill Clinton indicted or thrown in jail.  Hence, Clinton was criticized for his sordid affair with Monica, but was more or less given a free pass on Chinagate, which happened to be a much more serious matter.   These are, to be sure, complicated matters, difficult to thresh out, and not easily made the stuff of polemical writing, which tends to remain on a highly general level, free of the nuances and subtleties characteristic of reality.  Hence my slight dissatisfaction with Coulter's book.  I think it could have been a lot better.
A4A329L5YY0T7	November 6, 2002	5.0	From the looks of the Nov. 5 election results, somebody must have taken this book to heart.  The more people read about the politics of liberalism, the more likely they are to vote Conservative, that is, Republican.  Coulter painted a very unflattering picture of the liberal "thinkers" and commentators in this book.  Anyone who reads this book is certain to do some thinking of their own. Read it carefully, learn from it, and vote Republican from now on.
A4A329L5YY0T7	July 14, 2002	5.0	Liberals aren't going to read this book.  Won't that hurt sales?  Probably not.  Ann Coulter demonstrates quite well, by analyzing book sales statistics and records, that liberals don't read books.  Not even books written by liberals. The major book publishers won't publish books written by conservatives.  But that's OK because Regnery (and apparently Crown Publishers) will publish them.  And it is amazing how many "surprise best sellers" Regnery has published over the last three years.  Of course, Regnery doesn't give the huge seven figure contracts  that the liberal publishers keep giving to liberal authors like Bill and Hillary Clinton.  It seems that a lot of those favored authors lose their publishers a lot of money.  A strange business practice to continually lose money on liberal authors rather than publish conservatives.  Apparently, liberals really do hate conservatives. Coulter illuminates that hate by quoting liberals liberally in her book.  She quotes their propaganda, lies, misrepresentations and slanders.  She reveals their double standard that says to magnify anything remotely negative that  can be linked to Republicans; ignore and bury anything negative that could be applied to Democrats, including the more than credible allegation that Bill Clinton raped Juanita Broaddrick.  No doubt, the people she quotes--exposes would be a better word--were quite surprised that someone produced a book that compiled so much of their "offerings."  Coulter demonstrates their biases, providing an excellent, validating follow-up to Bernard Goldberg's "surprise best seller" Bias. Coulter's book gets a lot of one-star reviews from offended liberals here on Amazon.com, probably none of whom have actually read the book.  It's too bad those people won't read "Slander". It is quite absurd that some of these "reviewers" have accused Coulter herself of "lies, slander, and libel", especially when one considers that the whole book is based on direct quotes of liberal journalists, pundits, and politicians.  Every quote is fully documented.  Where is the slander? Show us the libel.  Exactly where and about what does she lie?  One's credibility is seriously doubted when such charges are made without facts to back them up.  Even more absurd is the claim that the mainstream media, including CBS, NBC, ABC, and CNN are biased in favor of conservatives (Republicans).  Truly amazing! It is clear from reading liberal reviews of conservative books, as well as from liberal media commentary, that liberals have little use for facts and evidence.  They base everything on feelings.  They feel it is perfectly justifiable to "spin" their way through everything.  This is why their preferred method of "debate" is name calling and insults.  For example, all conservatives are "dumb", including all Republican Presidents. Only Democrats are smart.  Al Gore was so smart that it became a handicap in the 2000 election campaign.  It was not the rarely reported dumb things and lies he constantly stated during his campaign that turned off so many voters; it was that he was so much smarter than the voters.  The brilliant Al Gore, who couldn't recognize busts of George Washington and Ben Franklin at Monticello, who flunked out of Divinity school and dropped out of law school, had to face "dumb" George W. Bush in 2000.  Couldn't the Republicans provide a more worthy opponent?  Isn't it amazing how much smarter George W. got after 9/11?  Could it be that the liberals were trying to deceive the voters during the election by calling Bush dumb? Clinton worshipers will hate this quote from Slander on page 147, referring to Bush's performance after the 9/11 terrorist attack:      "America had a leader who said what he meant and meant what he said--and just in the nick of time.  Having cleared out the pizza boxes, women's panties, and other detritus of the Caligula administration, the country was finally being run by grown-ups again." I wonder how many people realize what a miracle it is that a Republican ever gets elected President.  Consider that most university faculties seem to be dominated by liberal professors.  The mainstream TV networks are all liberal. The cable news networks, with exception of Fox, are clearly liberal.  Liberals dominate the newspapers and the major news magazines. The major publishing houses are controlled by liberals.  The public is constantly bombarded pro-Democrat, anti-Republican propaganda.  Fortunately, conservatives totally dominate talk radio--Rush Limbaugh, et al.  What kind of people listen to talk radio instead of "rock and roll"?  Educated folks who want to stay informed, perhaps?  Conservatives also read books.  They understand where the liberal agenda is trying to take this country and they are not willing to go.  The mass of less informed and less thoughtful voters hear the constant criticisms and attacks on TV and elsewhere.  They are easily persuaded. The fact is that liberals depend on the ignorant and uninformed to vote them into power.  Liberals have a vested interest in keeping our schools less than adequate.  Liberals want to convince as many people as possible that they are "victims" who must depend on "compassionate" Democrats to provide them with a subsistence-and to protect them from those "heartless" Republicans.  Why was the vote so close in Florida in 2000?  Could it be because the large population of retirees there were constantly told that they would lose their social security pensions if Bush won?  Of course, it might have been because thousands of Republican voters left long voting lines after the networks prematurely called Florida for Gore.  It even might have been because CBS announced 18 times during the last hour that Florida polls were still open that all Florida polls were closed.  It is too bad that the one-star reviewers here refuse to read Slander before they denounce it.  They might actually be able to refute something Coulter said if they read it. Maybe, but don't count on it.  For anyone who seeks after the truth, Slander is a must read.  This book makes clear what conservatives are up against each Election Day.  With the liberals in charge of most political reporting, the conservatives don't have any votes to spare.
A4BWRDMRF4637	July 12, 2003	2.0	but rather to be heaved with great force! I could only get through fifty pages of this book (including checks on her alleged footnotes), ands skimmed the rest to see if it got any better, before I realized there is no substance behind the sensationalistic charges she rattles off by the ton. I realized I could make better use of my time (my toenails were in need of trimming, for example) than trying to slough through this overwrought diatribe. Instead of explaining her confrontational charges, and substantiating her views, she simply goes on to the next charges. The opportunity to educate those of us who don't get it is never taken, so we are stuck wondering what it is she knows that we don't. She never tells us.  With all the press this book has received I was hoping there would be something substantive to it. There is not. (For a point of comparison, I suggest Bernard Goldberg's book Bias, which is thoughtful, substantive, and readable, all qualities lacking here).  This no doubt labels me, according to some of the other reviews, as a liberal. To these reviewers things are simple-- conservatives must love this book because they are conservatives, and liberals must hate it because they are liberals, and therein lies the problem. Ms. Coulter's book is aimed at those thin slices of America that think in terms of labeling all of us, and then proceeding to attack those with different views (labels). Her style of discourse is what this country needs less of, not more, regardless of your political views. How can anyone take seriously a book or author who tells you, several times in the first fifty pages, that liberals hate America! Does she actually believe this? Is this a way to talk with those who disagree with you?  As an example of her style, she takes a couple of people (Norman Mailer, Al Sharpton, etc.) as the standard for liberalism in this country. Clinton gets a lot of play, too. You know how liberal he is! While this may win points in Debating 101, it does nothing in regard to demonstrating thoughtfulness or insight. Is this really a starting point for meaningful discussion of our common problems and interests? And speaking of labels (they at least make it easy to figure out who is who, at least in her world) I would suggest that Ms. Coulter does a disservice to conservatives by wrapping herself in their flag. If conservatives truly look to someone who writes like this to be a leader in espousing their positions, then conservatism is worse off than I thought it was. All this kind of book does is get the truly faithful (really, the fringe and diehards) riled up. Oh, yeah, one more thing, it sells books.
A4NHULO8XEEWX	November 20, 2002	5.0	Let's be clear here: some people don't like Ann Coulter's views and so they criticize her style.   They should deal with the facts for which she provides documentation.  Some examples: 1. The spate of cruel comments about the physical appearance of Linda Tripp, Paula Jones or Katherine Harris (pgs. 17-19) 2. The fact that on a poll, three fifths of the American people who heard Juanita Broaddrick claim tha Bill Clinton raped her thought it was true (pg. 19) 3. That ABC News used two former Clinton staffers to balance each other's political commentary (pg. 61) 4. The interesting and under-reported fact that in the 2000 election CNN tended to call close states for Gore a lot faster than it called states that Bush won handily (pg. 87) Why is this important?  In the closest election in American history, this slanted coverage created the impression that Bush's campaign was going down and arguably suppressed the vote. There is a lot more. This book is well sourced and poses a significant challenge to those who would criticize it.
A5CEME3D4E4G4	June 30, 2002	1.0	Ann Coulter is the James Carville and Paul Begala of the right.  Giving the Liberals back some of what they get away with daily on CNN!! They ALL do a GREAT disservice to political dialogue in this country!!  Coulter's book is WAY over the top, but evidently is finding lots of fans.  Sad!!!
A5WMBIOGE8Q6N	August 12, 2003	3.0	Ann H. Coulter attacks the liberal positions, philosophies, and outlooks throughout the book.  I was expecting more academic rigor and stronger factual support to build a case of slander. Law punishes slander, but we haven't seen a lot of punishment by the law, so that begs the question, "Do we live in anarchy?"  Liberals decide which laws to enforce, who should be punished by law and who can be given leniency.  Coulter's stories and insights are public knowledge, anyway, so the book seemed more of an accounting of the liberal accomplishments than a case for slander in the courts that I was expecting from the title (at least from an advertising point of view, it worked-I bought the book!)  The strategy seems to be:  Attack the Liberals to appease them by using their own style of rhetoric, which turns out supporting them.  Why not?  Am I confused? She needs to write more books-not that I loved her style and want to read more pro-liberal debates-but because by writing more, she may figure out how to write something more substantiated that would be worth reading.  We know the liberal ideas and Coulter needs to demonstrate she knows the conservative ideas.  If you don't actively read "The New York Times," then some of the information brought up in the book will be insightful to you.  I spent as much time searching the appendix for Coulter's sources of information as I did on the chapters she wrote.  In many ways, the book restates and interprets much of the liberal media stories directly from the newspapers.  The flavor was, "If you missed this article in the paper, then I'm going to make sure that you know all about it now!" Powerful, rich, epicurean liberals are not threatened by Coulter's arguments; if anything, the arguments are a recounting of liberal successes.  They are amused at the programs for the poor, strongly supported by unions, single women, blacks, and the rich.  They despise the Republicans labeling them as stupid, tax-loving advocates of Nazism (the right wing conspiracy.)  Coulter says liberals hate patriotism, the flag, and a strong military defense and think flag celebration is silly.  Liberals have undermine the security of this country.  Likewise, Liberals control the media bias but deny any unfair character definition, biased editorials, or liberal philosophies in the media. Coulter demonstrates liberal media control by rehashing the Gore and Bush election announcement giving Gore the win and switching after Fox announced Bush won.  The Florida Supreme Court expanded the regulations, smashing common sense and suffocating the process with regulatory interpretation based on fear. Four times, Gore had a chance to take the election from Bush.  It seems that Coulter has built a strong case that the liberals control the media and politico-legal machinery.  So what?  That's politics!  It's powerful, it's intelligent, it's corrupt, and people tolerate it anyway!  Liberals are advancing their vision of America, and the world is their message. I will say Coulter's analysis of the "Conservative Right" caught my attention.  In the "Battle for God, " protestant fundamentalism is the sleeping giant.  It's very powerful and has strong media exposure, political interest lobbying capabilities, and can invoke a strong patron response.  Coulter thinks the liberal tactic for dealing with the "Conservative Right" (a hateful slang term for those who think logically) is to first call them fanatics, second to generate a language of hate and even deny they exist or at least not recognize them for fear of drawing attention to them, and third of all, to call them intolerant and dictatorial. Coulter recounts a Jesse Ventura interview when Ventura spoke his mind with courage calling the Conservative Right "weak minded" and organized religion authorities "dictatorial," telling people "what to think."  It is a well-used liberal tactic to avoid the discussion of ideas and to label the conservatives as stupid-their other arguments fall flat as unmitigated lies.  Ventura immediately lost public support, but in one fell swoop, he caught the attention and admiration of liberals in the media and politics who praised his courage.   The liberal uncertainty is evident when dealing with the Conservative Right.  Liberals find the Conservative Right "irritating" and "difficult to control."  Liberal legislation continues to oppress the Conservative Right, as does hate crime legislation, judicial expansion and abortion.  Freedom of Speech protects the liberal tirades while suppressing the Conservative reactionary response, labeling it "intolerant and irrelevant." In one final mistake, Coulter does not even  make an attempt to reverse the perspective and tell how the Conservative Right views the liberals or what course of action they have decided to take to oppose the liberal force.  Is she afraid to look at it from "their" point of view for fear that she might be "to hard on the liberals or a Christian Fundamentalist", or does she just feel like riding the top of her wave of "liberalisms" without apology to those she pretends to squash with her rhetoric about the liberals ruling over the Christians?  I think she falls flat because of her blatant, ex-parte outlook.  No positions of strength or outlook.  Come Coulter you can do better.
A9K9ERLW6KKNR	October 6, 2002	5.0	After I saw Ann Coulter on Hannity & Colmes, I realized just how willing to take on the liberal left and the biased media Coulter is.  There aren't many people willing to expose the media for what it is:  a left-leaning, "some of the facts" news reporting that is insanely biased against the right side of the political equation.  It was a breath of fresh air watching her duke it out with Alan Colmes (a commentator I always disagree with, but whom I deeply respect for his down-to-earth, consistent belief system, and his humility in presenting it; Hannity is cocky, much as I agree with him on most things), and I was compelled after her appearance to buy her book to see what else she has has to say. It's safe to say I was shocked at the way she goes about tearing the liberal left to shreds.  Rush Limbaugh's books in the early 90's were harsh on libs, but whoa!  Coulter is harder. She makes a bazillion and one good points on topics ranging from liberal bias in the media to religion to how liberals operate and she neatly exposes their shortsightedness and inconsistencies.  I like the book for those reasons, and the fact that she's very hard-line on a wide range of issues. However, I am disappointed with the way she goes about it.  Limbaugh was able to make many of the same points, but he was not nearly as invective as Coulter is.  Granted I agree with Coulter 100%, but I see an almost hypocritical method she used to make her points:  she (rightly) criticizes the left and the media for bashing conservatives, but her return fire (besides presenting irrefutable facts) is to slash and burn with the same hateful tone that the libs and the media use when they attack conservatives.  I disagree with the invective manner with which she fires back. Still, the book is a breath of fresh air for the conservative audience.  Instead of being criticized (a daily occurance in every media outlet save for the Fox News Network), conservatives get a chance to fight back, even if all they do is agree with Coulter as they read.  It's nice not to have one's opinion thrown in their face once in a while. Sean Hannity has just released a decent publication, and we're all still waiting (some of us more patiently than others!) for Limbaugh to pick up the pen again...
AAECAHBNP1VD2	September 14, 2004	1.0	when will Coulter find a meaningful job instead of spending her time blaming liberals for everything wrong in this country? Do her arguments hold water? Yeah, the same way Michael Moore's did in Farenheit 911. If Coulter wants to truly face the truth ... something she apparently has trouble with, what's wrong with this country -- al least a major chunk of it -- can be traced to... can it be? Shock of shocks! Ronnie Reagan, a CONSERVATIVE! If you can get past the propaganda after his funeral and really look into his administartion, he was responsible for a number of things, not the least of which is the ruined economy, school-program cuts (including lunch; ketchup was a vegetable, remember?), tax laws designed to shelter the rich and shrinking healthcare provisions. Gee, what a proud heritage. But Coulter just likes to hear herself talk, apparently, leaving logic and facts aside until they conveniently fit in. As someone else said, why doesn't she do a book about the hardly-right right, people who believe in laws that suppress human rights, who want to control our private lives, and who want only the wealthy to ultimately survive? How do you spell nausea? C-O-U-L-T-E-R
ACA48HEX8BGQW	November 16, 2002	1.0	If I want reasoned conservative opinion I'll read Safire, Dowd, and maybe Noonan or Wills.  Coulter is a low-class broad. Coulter is an empty-headed, hateful, hostile slogan engineer.  She reminds me of the people who drew Jews with dirty beards and hoards of gold in political cartoons in prewar Germany. Ugh. Reading her words makes me feel soiled.
AENXJM2CKEN5L	September 30, 2002	4.0	Slander:  Liberal Lies About the American Right written by Ann Coulter is a well written book with a pitbull approach in exposing the liberal adgenda as she examines with incisive reasoning and meticulous research the events and personalities that have shaped modern political discourse. I found this book to be an eye-opening account of the biased media exposing namecalling, bickering, and backstabbing as the bill d' fare of the liberal side, but that's politics as we now know it when a liberal has a comment or point of view.  Ann Coulter can be a real bull dog in her prose and cut to the chase, where she puts a line in the sand and dares the reader to cross it.  This book is very well written and makes her point with cogent intellect without the artificial pretenses. The narritive is fast paced and reads more like an editorial in the newspaper as she takes mainstream media to task.  For a fresh and fascinating look at what makes Ann Coulter tick read this book and you'll find out... she really is one of the best women in politics with level-headed approach with a conservative leaning, but that really balances, what for years has been, the liberal biased media.  She really makes her point... like Rush Limbaugh... only much better on the eyes. A conservative tour de force... against liberal propaganda.
AFHQQWJBJ4ZQL	October 3, 2004	1.0	This is got to be the most ignorant book I have ever read! She's just like Rush Limball.
AFXMTGF9XLJM1	March 13, 2003	1.0	A "Republican Trial Lawyer from NY, NY" said: Liberals should read this book (perhaps getting it at the library to avoid paying royalties :>)     ----------------- Abbie Hoffman had a different theory about how to acquire a book. . .  ----------------- This FDR Democrat trial lawyer from the Upper West Side  bought the book and he suggests that this book proves Mark Twain correct: one should never see how sausage, laws or Right-wing Blonde's (popular books) are made. Ann H. Coulter defines Mendacity...she creates simple slippery slope arguments and then she babbles on to  prove that the last true Pundit of the Right with a Brain was Bill Buckley. Impressive? Only for her royalty income. This week. If any of the folks who enjoy this book think it contains substance . . . I suggest that the footnotes be fact-checked.  Popular right-wing books do not require this standard of care (see, e.g. "Dutch" ).  This law journal technical editor (in law school) would have returned the manuscript for fact checking. For all of you who love this book: just buy more copies.  Mona and Rush will be unhappy at the drop in their sales, but Ann is a Blonde!
AH5BG0ATYB1V2	June 28, 2002	1.0	I am a conservative, but I was extremely repulsed by this .... this .... thing.  In a time where, more than ever, conservatives and liberals should be united for the causes of liberty, Coulter presents this hate-filled, acidic harangue against anyone who is not in lock step with the conservative agenda.  It is quite ironic that Coulter responds to liberal mocking of conservatives by writing a book which serves no purpose other than to mock liberals. Cmon, Ann, be the bigger person!  As a Republican, I want what is best for my party, and having people write garbage like this will certainly not accomplish anything.  If anything, it will further the hatred and drive conservatives and liberals farther apart.  Idealogically, I agree with Coulter on many issues, but it saddens me that she presents her ideas in such a childish and moronic way.  She's simply the female equivalent of Rush Limbaugh ... if you are looking for an intellectual discussion on conservatives and liberals, please - for the love of all that is sacred - skip this book.
AJ1XZYGXJGKU4	September 21, 2003	1.0	This woman is a cruel, sadistic liar.  She attacks and lies attacks and lies and attacks and lies and she never stops.  Reading her book you get the impression that Hitler's Propaganda Minister isn't really dead.  He just had a sex change and now he looks like a Playboy model. Of course her friends are hate-filled sadists like the Reverend Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson, so we shouldn't be surprised.  Should we? I'm a strong believer in Freedom of Speech and Freedom of the Press, but some people abuse that freedom.  Telling lie after lie after lie after lie after lie is NOT what freedom of the press was supposed to be all about. If this woman had any ethics she would feel shame for the lies she's told and the smear tactics she's used. I'd like to know how her publishing house even justified publishing such a work of hatred and deception.
AKBP01ZIFKGMM	August 22, 2003	5.0	Ann Coulter is absolutly brilliant! With this excellently researched and thourghouly documented book she exposes the left for what it is, liars whose only way of winning is by personal attack. In this book she exposes how... The left can only win debates by calling their oponents stupid Liberals have opnely lied about the bias in the media Liberals have a double standard in how they treat Republicans and Democrats Leftists like AlGore have twisted the Bible to their own beliefs. (Cain and Able a story about pollution? Give me a break!) Liberals like AlGore have openly lied during their campaings. (Syaing his mother sang him the look for the union label song as a baby. Too bad it wasn't written until Gore was 27!!) Liberals have to hide their agenda behind code words like "pro choice" or a "woman's right to choose" Feminists have helped to destroy our society. With all these issues and many more Ann COulter exposes the left as the traitors they are. We need more women like her in our country. God Bless Ann Coulter and God Bless America!!
AL7LEBKKW8XCC	August 1, 2002	4.0	Slander focuses on Ann Coulter's belief about a massive left wing conspiracy bringing down American right. In her book, she does bring out some interesting topics such as the common use of of such terms of 'right-wing' republican or 'religious conservative' while terms such as 'left-wing' democrat or 'pro-union libeal'. However, a lot of her basis for saying this is her searching terms into a lexis-nexis search. Just because the media fails to use certain terms as much as others doesn't mean that they don't exist on realilty. Though, the I agree the media use of such term does in a way demonize them. Of course there are plenty or left-wing democrats and pro-union democats, just as many as right-wing republicans or religious conservatives. Such labels to conservatives have not really hurt their cause, electing popular presidents like Ronald Reagan, and both Bushes or appointing supreme court justices like Rehnquist and Thomas or cabinet members like Ashcroft. In addition, one can see the popularity of such conservatives as Rush Limbaugh, O'Riley and even Ann Coulter herself. Yet I find it interesting that Coulter takes such a hard line stance against moderates in the Republican such as Todd-Whitman  and some Senators she describes as the 'New York Times favorite Republicans' (page 177) including Shelby, Specter, Snowe, Collins and Chafee. It's interesting to hear her describe them in such a way, because she seems to say that liberals act in that matter.  Coulter does make some good points such as how the media fails to attack the Democrats from taking money and depending on unions and special interests similar to the Republicans taking money and depending on groups such as the moral majority, the NRA and big business. Also, she deals with how the media is critical of people who used to work for republicans while not giving the same to people who used to work for democrats. Also there are points about liberals are quick to label the right as stupid, idiotic, racist... without really going into much detail about why. Coulter also provides a good defense of Fox News and other right-leaning news sources such as the Wall Street Journal as a means of getting the conservative cause out. This helps to balance things out against more left-wing news sources. In terms of demographics, she does bring out how the so cold religous right is more likely to vote democrat then such special interests to the Democrats such as African-Americans and single-moms.
AMWSZ61FILX2J	August 21, 2002	3.0	This book crackles and pops with hard hitting and logical analysis of just how biased and pervasive the liberal spin in the media has become. The book is not written as a textbook, so in that respect it may come across as a rather venomous novel than objective research to some readers. This book is not truly objective, although it contains much objective data and detail. It doesn't need to be as the evidence is quite clearly supportive of her views, but those criticisms are valid.  Here are the high points in my view:  The subject matter is investigated thoroughly and the blistering attacks on the so called "untouchables" and media darlings, are exposed and detailed in such a way as to remove all doubt of the claims being made.  The book reads like an editorial column in places, and is actually quite funny. I laughed out loud, (usually at the expense of one of the liberal elite like Katie Couric) and chuckled at the prose.  The book is accurate. Not in an FBI kind of way, but rather like the small child who says the "emperor isn't wearing any clothes". This is fitting because the subject matter is so obvious to anyone not blindly following our liberal media darlings that it hardly needs any deep investigation to uncover.  The section on book publishing, internet usage and radio ratings are worth the book price alone. Here, in the last vestiges of free choice and provable and measurable American public opinion, the real feelings of our country are apparent. Conservative books, internet boards, and radio shows so vastly outperform their liberal counterparts that the choice of "the people" is obvious. This choice contrasts sharply with what the television networks, and New York Times and other NY/LA elite try and tell us about what we as the American public think.  My complaints of the book are as follows:  At times the attacks are a bit too emotional. The factual evidence is so obvious and so completely proves her points that some of the more critical attacks in the book serve only as amusing anecdotes, and do not add to her case and may alienate those on the fence.  The title is misleading. The book is not really centrally about the "Liberal lies about the America right" as much as it is about the "liberal lies about everything". As is presented here, there doesn't seem to be any truth in any of what the liberal spin machine presents, on really any subject matter.  Overall, I enjoyed the prose, and agree with the glaringly obvious conclusions presented here. It should be noted however, that the obviously hypocritical viewpoints of the liberal elite in this country do far more damage than help some of the excellent and needed liberal causes. I know many liberals who are outstanding, caring and concerned citizens, and who are also offended by the pathetic offerings of the liberal media. So in its zeal to expose the American people to the nonsense that is being spun to them, I wonder if she has gone too far in polarizing the issue? Read the book, compare it to your experience, and decide for yourself.
ANNCLJCMWNVVE	July 10, 2002	1.0	According to Ann Coulter, there isn't a single decent person who is politically left of Dick Cheney. Every single liberal lacks morals and is involved in some evil conspiracy in Ann's world.  The book is strong on emotion(hatred mostly)but weak in every other way. This totally biased book actually accuses liberals of name calling when in fact she name calls and libels the left through the entire book.  In fact the title should be "Libel" instead of "Slander".
ANNMHVOXZQU2K	August 21, 2003	1.0	I would say that the title of Ann Coulter's book is exactly that, except for one thing - in print, it's called libel, and this book is nothing more than a libelous attack on liberals, who she sets out to blame for anything that she can think of, without stopping to care if she's right or not.  Miss Coulter relies on shock and biting humor, not documented facts - she's a blonde Rush Limbaugh.  She has come to fame in the same manner that many of her cohorts, such as Bill O'Reiley and Chris Matthews have - a sharp tongue and gallons of hot air to go around. Sure, trying to find a book on politics that isn't excessively one-sided is like trying to find a pearl in Siberia, but if you want a pro-conservative book that is worth some merit, don't look here.  Miss Coulter, it appears, cannot distinguish between truth and lies (she *is* an attourney), and she goes too far with her insults, leaving any shred of decency at the door.  Once, on a show, she said to a caller, a crippled Vietnam Vet who had lost his legs, that "it's because of people like you that we lost that war." I'm a liberal mostly, but I will listen to the other side - if they have something of merit to say besides lashing insults at everyone with a different point of view.  Don't waste your money on this - keep it or buy something that's worth the paper it's printed on.
AQLQZD16N126R	July 1, 2002	5.0	It is very clear that those with the one sentence, one star, reviews did not read the book.  I did.  It is very hard to argue with the well researched facts and logic.
AQVJ98UIFHR0T	July 16, 2002	1.0	While biases, both Left & Right, do exist in the media, this is precisely the wrong book to shed light on the subject.  Coulter has assembled a fine roadmap for those who want to take a potentially interesting idea and turn it into unidimensional screed utterly devoid of any semblance of either objective reasoning or actual debate. While complaining about Liberal ad hominem attacks, she launches anti-Liberal ad hominem attacks.  While complaining about Liberal misrepresentations in the press, she repeatedly misquotes & alters her press references. She uses such cheap tricks as quoting the same article four times & implying the existence of four seperate articles; citing opinion colums as evidence hard news is biased... The list goes on forever. If you think Rush Limbaugh is a deeply philisophical & introspective man, this book is for you.  If you actually want to read an exploration of political ideals & their expression (and want the Conservative viewpoint), check out William Safire, or any number of lucid, erudite Conservative commentators that actually address an issue or two....
AR2DE47VCY1C8	December 21, 2002	5.0	Not surprisingly, reviewers of this book either love it or hate it--give it 5 stars (as have I) or 1 star, and those who do the latter protest because they can't give it no stars at all. The reason?  Ann Coulter writes passionately, and she minces no words--she is a conservative, and she dislikes the liberals' polemics, which she claims are mainly lies, ad hominem attacks and slander--a claim she backs up very effectively with detailed quotes, naming names and places. She discusses, in detail, the left-leaning elite media and gives examples of the way in which they ignore people with whom they disagree, like Phyllis Schlafly, and build up liberals like Gloria Steinem, who--according to Coulter--is a ridiculous figure and a failure at all she attempts, who had to sleep with a media mogul to get money to keep her magazine, Ms., going. And, yes, she names him. Love it or hate it, this is a book to reckon with.  It is certainly polemical, but she lists her sources, names names, gives explicit quotes, and makes her argument hard to refute.  The result?  Liberal readers go nuts!  They can't argue with her, so they indulge in name-calling and disparage her parenthood--the very things she says they do, in the book, rather than make coherent arguments. When they don't like what they hear from someone who accuses one of their icons--i.e.: Linda Tripp, Paula Jones or Catherine Harris--they attack their looks, calling them "ugly and evil," "a snitch, and an ugly one at that," "Barracudaville," or "smelling of gunpowder and garlic," instead of refuting the accusations.  "This," says Coulter, "from the party of Bella Abzug."  She makes a good case for media bias, as well, and says that the elite media is far more liberal than even the Democrat constituency.  And she pretty much makes an irrefutable case for her claims. So, as a conservative--biased as I am--I think it is a good book.  From my standpoint, it reads like the truth.  But then, I am, as the liberals would say, just a "Redneck" in "Flyover" country; not a Hollywood star, like Sean Penn, with vast knowledge of foreign affairs.  Or Barbra Streisand, who advises presidents.  What do I know, anyway? Joseph Pierre author of "Handguns and Freedom" and other books
AZ5250G2U795I	September 4, 2002	1.0	Bought this book and I wish I could warn potential buyers with negative stars. One is the lowest I can give it and that is way more than it deserves. While I don't dispute that media has a liberal bias (They depend on the First Ammendment -- they need all the leway they can get), Ms. Coulter does not do her party justice for anyone who can recognize a well constructed and persuasive argument. I was shocked at how poorly this author worked through her arguments, as well as beat many a dead horse. (Several chapters were simply rehashings of previous chapters) While I don't disagree with many of the concepts Coulter attempts to examine, I felt like her argument was the literary equivalent of a temper tantrum; lots of bluster and fuss but nothing presented in a rational manner. Two major problems I had with the book in general is that Coulter resorts to the acid-tongued snideness and name calling she accuses liberals of spouting. She also theorizes that Clinton's crimes were WORSE than Nixon's; an argument that sounds preposterous as it is laid out in her book. At times, I felt she simply wanted to use this book as a diatribe on how evil Bill Clinton is. I found the book generally a petty exercise in partisan politics and nothing more.  This is a topic worth examining, but cruise Amazon.com for something other than this book.
AZI0O32W4ZYGH	April 10, 2003	5.0	When a liberal opens Ann Coulter's book, it must be "shock and awe."  For all these years, liberals have used the power of the academia and the media to demonize conservatives, but they have done so mainly through emotional arguments, not substantive arguments refuting conservative philosophy.  Here comes Ann Coulter's book.  She carefully documents many of the cases where conservative political thought has been "slandered" by liberal commentators who are quick to call Republicans "dumb" -- and that alone is usually the end of the debate.   She also makes arguments and comments that are not seen in other conservative books.  Witty and sarcastic, she poses interesting questions such as why liberals are quick to condemn someone as a member of the "religious right" when such a group does not really exist.  She also further disproves the argument that Falwell and Pat Robertson all think alike or are "hard right."  Very interesting commentary you will not find anywhere else.
A11PTCZ2FM2547	May 1, 2003	4.0	It's common knowledge that the left is intolerant of dissent--that to oppose affirmative action one is a racist, to challenge NOW is to be a chauvinist, to be against abortion one is a religious fanatic.  The high priests and priestesses of political correctness have chastised, marginalized, critized, and demonized conservatism for more than 30 years; entrenched and enforced in news dissemination, higher education, wool-gathering think tanks, and the entertainment industry, they've had the bully pulpit to hammer home their leftist agenda and excoriate conservative dissent at will. Conservatism, of course, has fought back, often in the face of the most venomous vitriol imaginable.  Rush Limbaugh.  Michael Reagan.  George Will.  Cal Thomas.  Sean Hannity.  The success of talk radio and the 24-hour cable news cycle has given conservatism a strong foothold in its battle against the leftist status quo.  Outside of the antics of Rush and several off-the-wall comments by G. Gordon Liddy and others of his ilk, the conservative voice has been much more restrained and subdued than the in-your-face namecalling from the left. But then comes blonde, petite Ann Coulter, the epitome of a wolf in sheep's clothing.  The very title of her book, SLANDER:  LIBERAL LIES ABOUT THE AMERICAN RIGHT, is akin to walking into a biker bar to pick a fight.  And judging from the reviews on Amazon alone, the fight is on. In a nutshell, Coulter is over the top.  She is pure spit and vinegar as she attacks liberalism, blaming it for virtually everything but the common cold.  And it's darn funny, some of it laugh-out-loud funny, as she lambasts Clintonianism/feminism/activism with a crisp, witty style so reminiscent of her numerous appearances on the cable talk shows.  (Calling the Florida Supreme Court, during the 2000 election ordeal, a "kangaroo court" was priceless.)  Coulter gigs, gouges, pokes, and punches enough to make liberal pit bulls like Carville and Begala look like choirboys.  And her high-octane tone is relentless, almost to the point of exhaustion. Alas, the vituperation of SLANDER:  LIBERAL LIES ABOUT THE AMERICAN RIGHT only serves to drag Coulter's arguments down to the level of her emotional antagonists.  But then, come to think of it:  maybe it's high time the left got a taste of its own medicine. --D. Mikels
A151WXG0QWKLK9	May 29, 2003	1.0	...Ann Coulter comes from the Rush Limbaugh school of conservativism- instead of using facts or numbers to support arguments, make flippant, insulting remarks or simply not allow them to speak.  While their ignorance is entertaining, it's sad that so many people turn only to people like them to get their news.   This book appears heavy on facts to bolster her arguments, but, when checked for validity, many of the footnotes provide very weak reinforcement or none at all... Regardless of political affiliation, please don't choose a side and then tune in to talking heads who simply spew out rhetoric that panders blatantly to the left or right.  Sadly, both sides are so close-minded that they cannot see that both sides are correct, and both sides are wrong.  As with most things in life, the best course for our government lies somewhere in the middle.
A15WUOMW0O7ZM4	July 7, 2002	3.0	If Coulter was any more "in your face" to the liberal population she'd be staring into one of Tom Daschel's nostrils. In fact, the more people who call her names based on their theoretically having read the book (not to mention the ones who call her names and openly admit they haven't read it), the more valid her work becomes. "Slander" is mainstream media-style journalism --only, in the case of Ann Coulter, there's factual documentation for each and every accusation. If the mainstream media, and the liberals in general, could provide the same level of documentation for their claims there'd be no basis for this book. They don't, so, like it or not, this is what needs to happen. What you're not going to find here, however, is an easy read. Coulter's writing style in "Slander" is horrifically convoluted at times. She seems to have so much to say and is so passionate about it, that the front half of the book is almost like riding the same roller coaster five times in succession. (I know, but there really can be too much of a good thing.) It's not until the last half of the book that she settles down and stops repeating herself incessantly (mostly). All in all, liberals will hate this book, conservatives will love it, and those who say they're conservative and claim they hate it are probably lying about being conservatives. But, according to "Slander" that's what liberals do so it shouldn't come as a big surprise.
A17FLA8HQOFVIG	February 21, 2003	2.0	Ann Coulter, the attractive blonde spokesperson for right-wing conservatives, is the author of this book.  Often, she appears on talk shows where she makes nasty comments about liberals.  She's an attorney too, and has learned how to research and document her position.  She believes it strongly and her passion for it spills over the pages of her book.  Whether it's true or her diatribe is justified is another matter. The examples she gives of liberal rhetoric from, most notably, The New York Times, among others, are all footnoted at the back of the book.  I haven't checked them out, but I do know that one looks hard enough, one can find documentation for almost anything.  The book decries the ways that liberals slander conservatives in the media.  But her invective against liberals could also be called slander.  She's smart and she knows it and is a master of using ridicule to make her points. I found some holes in her arguments, such as, after a computer search for the terms "far right extremist" and "far left extremist" she concluded that the term "far right extremist" was used much more often.  This doesn't seem to be a balanced search however.  The actual word "far left extremist" isn't really the term of choice when conservatives write about the left.  Aren't the terms more likely "tax-and-spend liberal", or "left-winger"? Ms. Coulter uses sarcasm and mean-spirited comments to make her points.  And I found the book too long and quite repetitive.  It should have been no longer than a magazine article, but she stretched it into 205 pages.  But yet... I did enjoy some of it.  I particularly loved her chapter on books, where she talked about books that the liberal press had refused to publish such as Rush Limbaugh's best sellers.  And she made a point on her chapter on conservatives being called names rather than dealing with the issues.  But doesn't she realize that she's calling names too? Only she phrases them in the jargon of intellectual snobbery.  Sometimes she's amusing and I laughed out loud.  But other times there is just page after page of the same old stuff.  Also, because I'm not as familiar with some of the columnists and personalities she deals with daily in Washington, I was often bored. I like to read books by people who are passionate about a topic.  And therefore I found it an enjoyable read.  But she made all her points in the introduction.  After that, it's just one long complaint about the way things are and the way she'd like them to be.  If you're very interested in the subtleties of political thinking and the various ways that the media insults conservatives, you might find this book mildly interesting.  All others stay away.
A17YYMLWF0R75A	December 2, 2002	5.0	Awesome, concise and cutting revelations about the media.  I loved her sometimes caustic and sarcastic barbs - pointing out the absurdities and slants in the left wing dominated media.  She doesn't mince words.  She calls a spade a spade - and completely ignores political correctness.  Loved this book!
A18CA0GRHDVP8X	March 3, 2003	1.0	"The Republicans have a problem...How can conservatives expect to win votes for an economic program so inimical to the middle class? The answer is they cannot--and they know it. Therefore most conservative ideologues have done their best to change the subject from the economy to what they like to call 'the culture'...Both race-baiting and the [sexual] politics of family values are part of the same Republican culture war strategy of diverting the anger of the white working class from the owners and operators of the Republican party--the corporate and hereditary rich--and focusing wrath on unpopular minorites..." "Supply-side economics, the myth of public school failure, and the illegitimacy-epidemic hoax are on the the tip of the iceberg. Other examples of the dissemination of half-truths and falsehoods by the foundation subsidized conservative intelligentsia...are not difficult to find..." Michael Lind UP FROM CONSERVATISM From Chapter Five, "Whistling Dixie"  "For those who don't know Ann Coulter, she is one of those blond, right-wing, talking heads who pop up on cable--the most outspoken one. 'We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity,' she remarked after the terrorist attacks." From the Booklist review of Slander: Liberal Lies About the American Right Ann H. Coulter  Ann is probably making sweet money from her book of diatribes--which, considering its lack of intellectual and historical vaidity, is I'm sure all that matters. I wonder, nonetheless, what she thinks of THE WAR ON FREEDOM by Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed... or DREAMING WAR, by Gore Vidal... or James Banford's BODY OF SECRETS, INSIDE THE NSA... or Michale Lind's UP FROM CONSERVATISM... or Conason and Lyons' THE HUNTING OF THE PRESIDENT... or Lothar Machtan's THE HIDDEN HITLER... or INTO THE BUZZSAW: LEADING JOURNALISTS EXPOSE THE MYTH OF A FREE PRESS by Kristina Borjesson... or Martin Luther King's STRENGTH TO LOVE... or *PAUL'S LETTER TO THE CORINTHIANS, 10:13*... I hear nothing even resembling the character or ideals upon which our country was founded between the covers of this book, only a NATIONAL ENQUIRER-type use of the First Amendment that is more than reminiscent of what she is attacking. It seems as if only a woman lost in the self-hatred many women believe they must embrace to make it in the sectors of the economy dominated by men--in this case, the homoerotic ultra-conservative shock jock world--could hold such views of people in our country with a kind of synthetic vitriolic pride; the kind of pride her oh-so-beloved Christian Bible must have told her goeth before the fall.  Is Coulter a pseudo-intellectual "private dancer" (Tina Turner) with conservatism for money (more commonly known as a, well, you know)? Or is she simply just a hired pseudo-intellectual assassin of the Left, with delusions of someday being either Limbaugh's mistress or the radio version of Condoleeza Rice? And does anybody really believe either of the two are relevant, let alone synonymous? I found nothing of value in this book. I doubt anyone else will--or really does.
A1B2ZJQTVK7BWX	December 4, 2002	5.0	What Miss Coulter essentially tells us here is that liberals argue in childish and hypocritical ways. Hard leftists are excepted, as they merely wish to talk all detractors to death. Liberals are the focus here, and they use methods that serve more to amuse their opponents than to do anything that could  ever help their cause. Typical is, the liberal says, The one thing I have have against all you hateful rightwingers is that you stereotype. Another is, All you rightwingers generalize. Miss Coulter points these things out to the great discomfiture of those broad-minded enough to accept the orthodoxies of the New York Times editorial page and this week's DNC talking points. For this she is damned, her appearance is attacked, and she is accused of, say, support for the Kaiser in WWI. The reaction to the criticism of liberals tells much about their current political status, ideas, and whether they are aware Eleanor Roosevelt has long since passed from the scene. Liberals whined; conservatives laughed. Miss Coulter has earned her scars--and she's laughed loudest.

A1EO7PWNB6868Z	June 30, 2002	5.0	"Methinks thou dost protest too much" would, I believe, prove to be a more than adequate Shakespearian quote to respond to the many frenzied protestations we find here amongst the reviews.  The fact is that Coulter's barbs, razor sharp and unforgiving, are mostly a collection of direct quotes showing a host of contradictions and expressing a myriad of lunacies which, unfortunately for the Democratic party, seem to have found a comfortable home within the liberal worldview.  I myself do not subscribe to the point of view that absolutely every notion that emanates from the left is destined to bring the downfall of American civilization (just a disproportionately large number of their ideas); however, Coulter does make a good argument to the contrary.  What cannot be disputed is the fact that Coulter does bring to light many straw man arguments used by the left with every breath and then goes about systematically dismantling them.  As an avid reader of the New York Times, an excellent paper in my opinion- though surely leaning towards the left of center to such a degree that it may soon topple over completely (Coulter would no doubt argue that my leaning "Times Tower of Pisa" has long ago fallen and crumbled)- I was very much entertained by her total evisceration of some of its duplicity in presenting itself as an utterly objective institution.  In her acknowledgements, this one dripping with sarcasm, she gives "sincerest thanks to Pinch Sulzberger and the entire staff of the New York Times, without whom this book would have been impossible."  Even though many people may harp about the inevitable disagreements that may arise between themselves and Coulter, how could it be otherwise in a book full of opinions, the truth is that Coulter does bring some interesting new perspectives to even seemingly tired topics such as the 2000 elections and the proposed regulations for the Internet.  Ultimately, I found the book extremely entertaining - laughing out loud a good two dozen times or so as I read it - but it is this same deadly combination of wit and well referenced liberal positions and quotes that will inevitably sting the more thin skinned of those with left leaning political inclinations!
A1FI4J3P8YDCL5	July 2, 2002	2.0	I read this book, it's inflamitory rhetoric for the sake of making people feel that the world is conspiring against them. This is exactly the point of the book, this is what the book is for, it does its job. Look at the title "Slander: Liberal Lies About the American Right", if you were expecting an even handed disection of media bias here you're an idiot. Ann isn't a great thinker she isn't a jornalist or a scholar she's a media figure just like Mahr or Moore or O'Rielly or Limbaugh however those who say she just throws out unsupported or out of context statments are only partially right, their are instances of this but they certainly aren't the rule. This book won't change your mind, liberals won't see the light and conservatives won't grow frustrated with Ann's selective definition of media that includes the Times and the Nation but not the Post or the Journal. Its not a good book but its not fiction, let's call it pulp-fact.
A1IH5JOIN6M2Y8	July 22, 2003	5.0	Written by conservative commentator Ann Coulter, "Slander" showcases the author's quick wit and endless passion for politics in the best conservative book since Rush Limbaugh's "See, I Told You So".  The focus of "Slander", Coulter's second book, is mainstream liberalism - its missteps, half-truths, and outright slanders.  Coulter presents her case in a well-reasoned, concisely written treatise that will leave its reader wanting for more.  Inside-the-beltway politicos and talk radio junkies will find that this book reads fast.  If you read it while you're walking, you're certain to smash face-first into a wall...  "Slander" tackles a number of subjects within the realm of conservative-liberal politics.  The left-wing media assault on the Fox News Channel and the "religious right" are two such examples.  Coulter exposes the myth of the "religious right" with a barrage of facts and footnotes, proving that if such a group exists at all, its numbers are miniscule at best.  The most interesting claim Coulter makes is that liberals don't read, at least not as much as conservatives...  She points out that almost half of all the bookstores in the United States are Christian bookstores (a group that is often maligned as intellectually bankrupt).  She also points out that while one conservative book after another climbs the New York Times bestseller list, only two liberal books of the last five years are worthy of note:  "Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot" by Al Franken and "Stupid White Men" by Michael Moore.  Incidentally, both books contain ad hominem attacks in their titles, illustrating her point that modern liberalism is intellectually bankrupt, and thus, must resort to name-calling and distortions of the truth in order to survive.  Whether you like Republicans or Democrats, one thing is certain - you'll love turning the pages of Ann Coulter's "Slander".  Highly recommended for both conservatives and liberals alike!

A1VTHUZIN04QQW	February 18, 2003	1.0	This book was a quick grab at an airport terminal on a delayed flight.  Throughout, she decries people called 'liberals' as the reason there are problems in the world...  But, Coulter says the US is infiltrated by a massive, secret army with a defined anti-good agenda that does everything it can to bring the country down. ...In any case, Coulter writes down to her audience, since I can't believe anyone with the intelligence to get a law degree can see the world in such a simplistic way...  ...Also, Coulter's views on race issues in this country are hilariously skewed.  Anyone who says the days of racial inequality are dead and gone has never set foot in an average town in America.  Racism is still alive and well, and, despite the progress being made on both sides of the color line, will be for many more years. Dividing millions of Americans into two camps - evil liberals and God-chosen conservatives, is an assault on the intelligence of anyone with the brains to read books.  It also makes it difficult to have intelligent discussions about government in this country without resorting to babyish name-calling and partisanship.   I guess this book was simply a drive at political comedy, since I can't believe the author took her own rhetoric seriously. -- JJ Timmins
A1WTCSBFHDKJMS	January 21, 2003	5.0	Ms. Coulter, fast becoming the bete noir of liberals, has penned a masterpiece exposing the intellectual dishonesty, and outright savagery of the mainstream press toward things conservative.  It is very difficult arguing against someone who quotes the very words you use in order to buttress their contention. This is exactly what Ms. Coulter does, and she does it relentlessly! We have become so conditioned to the "blabocracy's" prattle that we hardly notice just what fools they really are. But when you have what amounts to a compilation of their thoughts on the substantive issues of the day, you begin to see a pattern; a pattern of half-truth, in some cases no-truth, and generally a wanton contempt for the truth, if the truth does not jive with their worldview.  Slander has exposed the literati for what they are; petty, mean, vindictive, and intolerent of viewpoints other than their own. What is practiced by the mainstream press today is nothing more than de facto censorship, yet the talking heads piously proclaim their innocence. This in the face of literally mountains of evidence to the contrary (see "Bias," and "The Vision of the Anointed).  Ms. Coulter has made a significant contribution to the political dialogue in this country, this despite the fact that she has been virtually ignored by ABCCBSNBCCNNTHENEWYORKTIMESWASHINGTONPOST, et. al.  After reading this book you will see why sane people no longer rely on the "BIG 3" and their fellow mouthpieces for the Democratic party for their news, but rather are turning to alternatives such as Fox News, and the Internet for their information.
A1Z74SBY90BQWZ	July 6, 2002	5.0	Coulter makes a strong case that liberals have long given up legitimate debate in favor of name-calling and demonization.  At the same time, her return fire is so hot she makes a case for herself as the most gifted polemicist of the last decade.  Not even William F. Buckley at his most withering generated the kind of heat Coulter does.  It's clear that this book is the glove that slaps a face with every intention of starting a fight.  As a conservative frustrated by being constantly compared to Nazi's and racists for opposing things like high taxes, I found myself hoping someone would accept her challenge. The only possible criticism of the book is that Ann stoops the level of her opponents on several occasions by calling them dumb.  In fairness to her, she provides the evidence for her charge more often than not!
A2000DWMMYNIYB	August 20, 2002	5.0	Conservatives who seek words, ideas and great evidence to rebut the specious claims of liberals have a champion in Coulter's "Slander". She pushes the limit at times with some hyperbole but always makes her case. For example, Republican presidents deemed to be "dumb" by the liberal media stand up very well to the "bright" or unexamined liberal presidents and candidates. Or take Bob Packwood (few people would today) to learn about how a supporter of women's causes can be a "good" (read "liberal") Republican, until the truth gets out. Evidence, not slander, supports the conservative character. She makes point after point worth reading and remembering. She does a good job of writing what many -- perhaps most or all -- conservatives wish they had said or wished they had known before this book. Coulter adds to anicely building library of positive information and research from and about conservative people and their positions.
A22LX6529JJ166	July 20, 2002	4.0	Many valid points on the liberal bias of the electronic and print media.  But, coming from a slanted perspective of her own, she is just as biased.  This author is a Spin Doctor, no different than the Libs. in the media.  Instead of choosing one or the other, Americans should read, research, and think for themselves.  Choosing one side over the other is shallow, myopic, and intellectually limited.  Most of the differences between the Right and the Left are diluted today by big government, and big corporations----who are the ones really running America today.
A29LNXUJP5ANAL	January 20, 2003	3.0	The folks who are most likely to read a book by Coulter (conservatives and libertarians) are generally well aware of her thesis (mass media is dominated by proponents of the liberal point of view).  As such, there really isn't anything new here. That said, Ms. Coulter does a thorough job of documenting this bias.  On the downside, in pointing out the unsubstantiated generalisations of the left, she frequently throws out her own unsubstantiated generalisations as asides (for what its worth, I think most of her generalisations could be substantiated, but in a book that argues against such things, it seems a bit foolish for the author to commit the same sin). So, if you think mass media is objective or has a conservative bent, you should read this book and prepare to have your presuppositions challenged.  If you already think the media is dominated by east and west coast liberals, I would suggest looking for something else.
A2BMNZTOKJ89DX	September 25, 2003	5.0	I love Anne Coulter. After reading this work (and then picking up her other books to see what else she had to say) I felt myself being transformed somewhat. Like most of the nation, I watch the evening news, read the local paper, tune into NPR and take it all in. I make assumptions that what I hear and see is accurate and unbiased. It hadn't really struck me that the political bent presented on the airwaves was so stilted. Reading this book was like walking around, not knowing you had myopia, just assuming that the world was fuzzy on purpose, and suddenly going to the local optometrist, getting corrective lenses and WHAM!, seeing clearly for the first time. Do I think that Ms. Coulter is nuts? No, but then I'm not a liberal either, and that is definitely going to be a disadvantage when reading this tome. Is Ms. Coulter unbiased? Obviously not, but considering the liberal crappola I'm exposed to everyday, this is a nice balance of sorts. I do think Ms. Coulter is angry, but I also love getting the other side of the coin presented to me. I also find her use of end notes refreshing, not detrimental to the argument, as this is rare and if you don't believe her, look it up and read if for yourself. Reading the other commentaries on this book were amusing, the way an Al Franken book is amusing: you imagine a bratty child sent to their rooms and stomping about petulantly and muttering under their breath 'I'll show you!'. These are obviously not commentaries written by people who like reading the other side's response. I also think Al Franken is neither a deep thinker nor a polished writer and the more of him I read [like Michael Moore, another 'Big, Fat Idiot'] the more I think he's an imbecile and don't look forward to reading more of his drivel. To each his own, I guess. For every Michael Moore film you see, a Rush Limbaugh commentary should be included. For every Hiliary Clinton mock-up she has ghost-written for her, there should be a Bill O'Reilly follow-up. For every liberal, there is the common press and wire services. For the rest of us, there is enough Anne Coulter to bring us back to reality.
A2EQ74Y24BHHIF	June 30, 2002	5.0	This book represents a piece of first rate research overlaid with incisive analysis and wit.  Throughout the entire story Miss Coulter is deadly when it comes to ferreting out the abject lies and slanderous misrepresentations of the radical, religious Left.  In the first chapter she points out what has become obvious to anyone who has attempted reasoned debate with a Left-winger: when arguments are premised on lies, there is no foundation for debate.  She proceeds to point out that "logic is not their metier, blind religious faith is".   She develops the depth of Leftist hatred juxtaposed to their position of righteous superiority, but she avers that all that matters to them is power.  She quickly gets into development of the thesis that Left-liberals have enjoyed almost total control of the media over the last half-century.  She uses 35 pages including 780 cites to buttress her case.  In her critique she literally takes the intellectual analysis of the Left to the woodshed with devastating effect.  Rarely have I read someone with her wit, intellect and writing skills.  She's going to be a lot of trouble for those who subscribe to the mush-headed reasoning of the Left.  She's a talk-show terror.  She's far too bright for half-wits like Katie Couric and Bryant Gumbel.  And, the light weights anchoring the major networks should thank their lucky stars they won't have to go head to head with her on national television.    As Ann points out in her conclusions, Liberals have been wrong about everything in the last half century: Stalin, Reagan, the USSR, the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in the Spanish Civil War, Nicaragua, welfare, crime, social security, the Civil Rights Act, and the sexual revolution.  She next comments that all the Left has left is global warming, "coming in a thousand years to a planet near you", and abortion.   She pays particular note to the Left's indictment of the religious right, which she shows to be straw men extrardinaire.  In this exercise she makes a convincing case that the unifying characteristic of the Left is "hate". She's good.  Read this book.  Its truth will set you free.
A2EQ74Y24BHHIF	January 26, 2003	5.0	This book represents a piece of first rate research overlaid with incisive analysis and wit. Throughout the entire story Miss Coulter is deadly when it comes to ferreting out the abject lies and slanderous misrepresentations of the radical, religious Left.   In the first chapter she points out what has become obvious to anyone who has attempted reasoned debate with a Left-winger: when arguments are premised on lies, there is no foundation for debate. She proceeds to point out that "logic is not their metier, blind religious faith is".  She develops the depth of Leftist hatred juxtaposed to their position of righteous superiority, but she avers that all that matters to them is power.  She quickly gets into development of the thesis that Left-liberals have enjoyed almost total control of the media over the last half-century. She uses 35 pages including 780 cites to buttress her case. In her critique she literally takes the intellectual analysis of the Left to the woodshed with devastating effect. Rarely have I read someone with her wit, intellect and writing skills. She's going to be a lot of trouble for those who subscribe to the mush-headed reasoning of the Left. She's a talk-show terror. She's far too bright for half-wits like Katie Couric and Bryant Gumbel. And, the light weights anchoring the major networks should thank their lucky stars they won't have to go head to head with her on national television.   As Ann points out in her conclusions, Liberals have been wrong about everything in the last half century: Stalin, Reagan, the USSR, the Abraham Lincoln Brigade in the Spanish Civil War, Nicaragua, welfare, crime, social security, the Civil Rights Act, and the sexual revolution. She next comments that all the Left has left is global warming, "coming in a thousand years to a planet near you", and abortion.  She pays particular note to the Left's indictment of the religious right, which she shows to be straw men extrardinaire. In this exercise she makes a convincing case that the unifying characteristic of the Left is "hate".  She's good. Read this book. Its truth will set you free.
A2GZRD89C7KQE5	December 20, 2002	1.0	I picked up this book at the library because of how much buzz it has received, expecting a Republican rant to giggle about, or, perchance, an actual intelligent argument worth thinking about.  Unfortunately, after making myself read 40 pages after the first 2 (at which point i wanted to throw up and return the book), I have to conclude, in all seriousness, Ann Coulter is mentally ill. Completely unrelated to her political affiliation, I think her hate for "liberals" is not healthly. She could just as well have been a rabid liberal -- I think she has an obsessive personality that latches on to an idea to explore and twist it in every direction. It's unfortunate that Coulter is encouraged by the Republican establishment, because I think that, for her own good, she should be phased out of punditry. She does not make any logical arguments, she just seems to be deliriously foaming at the mouth, and it doesn't matter to her exactly what to foam about. As for her arguments, barely worthy of any refutation, she accusses liberals of never making logical arguments and just calling Republicans stupid, and the writes a 200 page book doing exactly that to liberals. She provides no argumentation, she just calls people names. There's nothing admirable about this; it's pathetic, and makes me pity her for being so obsessed beyond the reach of any reason.
A2HDK34425CC8N	September 23, 2002	4.0	Ann Coulter's the attack dog of choice for everyone who knew the liberals were getting off too easy from their friends in the media.  She's a good writer, she has her facts in order, but sometimes it seems she stretches to make her points. Slander is like National Review...or George Will, you agree with it -- mostly -- and when you disagree it almost always is a fruitful exercise to figure out why.
A2KG8WLR1AKO12	June 26, 2002	5.0	Ann Coulter's rhetoric may at times seem a bit bombastic and colorful,  but her arguments in Slander are cogent and cautiously stated.   It is also not a book written solely for a conservative audience .   On the contrary, Slander deserves the attention of everyone regardless of their own personal political predilections.  Coulter provides abundant evidence that our national discourse has been skewed by the major media outlets.  Thus, how can concerned citizens make wise decisions if legitimate and thoughtful positions are taken out of context and distorted? Many Liberals have no intention of taking any prisoners, and long ago tacitly realized that slander is an effective weapon to use against their perceived ideological foes.  This hostility is so intense that even economic self interest does not get in the way of pushing their uncompromising agenda, adds Coulter.  TV ratings may suffer and newspapers remain unsold, but an immature and anti-intellectual Liberalism remains in control.  Liberal politicians and intellectuals may endlessly make fools of themselves, but these individuals have little to worry about.  The Liberal media will simply look the other way and cover up their misdeeds.  Not so, for those embracing a more conservative temperament.  The latter are exhaustingly nitpicked and maligned as extremists committed to destroying our constitutional values and human dignity. Ann Coulter is hopeful that the Drudgereport and other independent voices on the Internet will do much to ameliorate this sad situation.  The larger media concerns must now worry that they will be taken to task whenever engaging in such outrageous misbehavior.  This was not the case just a few years ago. Coulter, it must be noted, is not a pessimist wallowing in defeatism.  Americans are not victims,  and she believes victory is realistically achievable.  We merely need to grab the bull by the horns.  The author has lighted the way---and the rest is up to us.
A2LP3RWE75ZA4O	March 6, 2003	4.0	Making a decision to buy this book is easy.  Go to a web site that has Ann Coulter's weekly columns, and if you like them, then buy this book.  It is like a great big column.  It is an entertaining, full of Ann Coulter's bitter sarcasm and reality check examples.  It is fairly light reading, and it is not all that well-organized, kind of like a long rant.  Still, it is definitely worth picking up if you like this sort of thing. "Slander" has a lot of original work that hasn't been addressed a great deal, even by other Conservative/Libertarian authors.  You don't find many regurgitated ideas in "Slander", and that is what makes the book worth reading.  One area that she gives a lot of attention to is the myth of the power of the Christian Right.  Another is her documentation of the "The Democrat is a genius intellectual, the Republican is a dope" strategy that Liberals and/or Democrats use every election cycle.  Going back to Carter vs. Ford, Coulter shows how laughable it is that this theme keeps showing up, election after election.  It's hard to disprove what she says, as she documents the source of all of her quotations and facts.  This book has hundreds and hundreds of footnotes.   Coulter also does a great job of making The New York Times look foolish (not that it's very difficult), repeatedly mocking the title "the newspaper of record".  She also targets Liberals who refuse to acknowledge that the Times is a left wing rag, pointing out how the paper has endorsed every Democratic presidential candidate since the 60's, including landslide losers Walter Mondale and Jimmy Carter.   Of course, the book is also filled with Coulter's usual hyperbole.  Since the whole point of the book is how Liberals use hyperbole and insults to describe Conservatives, then the entire work is somewhat hypocritical.  However, as I mentioned above. it is an entertaining read, and it does have a lot of useful information.  If you read Conservative literature, then make sure to pick this book up.
A2MFSTPX5IPPAR	June 28, 2002	5.0	... Coulter is one of the most refreshing columnists whose material is freely available on the web.  If you have read her columns, you know her prose drops like bricks with clear, shining, logic to construct the house of reason, each sentence building on the one before.  Its a beautiful thing to behold, someone that can write so clearly over the course of a thousand or so words. But how does that translate to a book of roughly 80,000 words?  In Slander, Ann Coulter pulls it off in an incredibly well documented and footnoted tome.  From her devastating proof of liberal bias in the media during the 2000 election, to her revelations of the so-called "revolving door" between Liberal administrations and the Press that reports on them, and her discussion of why Republicans are branded "dumb" and Democrats "to smart for voters to agree with," Ann Coulter continues and expounds on the thesis of Bernard Goldberg's book, Bias. In this book, Ann Coulter points out why Gucci Democrats (ANWR should be saved from the oil companies, but keep your damn greasy, scummy feet off my Public Beach in Malibu) should rightly be ridiculed.  She details the way these same Liberals, including Katie Couric, which she calls the Eva Braun of the Liberal Media Empire, fume that in a competitve marketplaces namely, radio, books and the internet, conservative viewpoints predomintate, thus depriving the Liberal media empire of its control. She points out how the media protects politicians with favorable viewpoints and turns on them when they are no longer needed.   She decontructs the myth of the Liberal media's favorite boogieman, the religious right, detailing how its been pronounced dead repeatedly in the past 20 years, only to be resurrected to scare voters when needed. In conclusion, she states that there have been no great Liberal acheivements over the past century and that the only thing Liberals have to cling to is the right to abortion, so its no wonder, since their viewpoints have been consistently and overwhelmingly discredited, that they resort to name calling and outright lying to push their vision, rather than rely on the marketplace of ideas and honest debate. Point made, superbly.
A2NEBS1KBSLQJ9	June 27, 2002	5.0	Any book about conservatives with as many negative reviews as it's gotten on this web site has to be a great book. I highly doubt any of the reviewers who gave this book such negative reviews actually bought this book much less read it, just a forum to spout their anti-conservative rhetoric and give authenticity to Ann Coulter's thesis. I have bought this book and read it just yesterday. These reviewers have no facts to back up their argument against Miss Coulter's book so they like any good liberal have made their book review a personal attack against Miss Coulter showing their true colors of intolerance. My suggestion is for all liberals to buy this book, read this book and then write a review on Amazon.com. For conservatives there's nothing in this book that you don't already know but buy it any way and give it to a liberal in your office or your cousin Eddy the Liberal. Read and enjoy
A2T2OVNIRFWS4R	August 27, 2002	3.0	Contrary to what another reviewer said, I don't think you have to either love or hate this book. It is an interesting read and has some very good points, but it also has obvious flaws. The problem with the book is, ironically, the same problem Coulter has with the mainstream media. Namely, the author is as biased and unobjective as the mainstream media she despises.    Coulter certainly has a good argument when she blasts the media for leftist bias. Much of the media is biased toward the left. Katie Couric, Bryant Gumbel, and many others in the press have unfairly attacked conservatives. Many in the media have an axe to grind and certainly Coulter deserves credit for calling them out.   So, why can I give the book only three stars? Simply, like many ideologues left or right,Coulter does not and perhaps cannot see the other side of the issue. Yes, CNN, the New York Times,and others are biased, but conservatives aren't exactly voiceless in the media today. Let's name a few: FOX News, Rush Limbaugh, the Washington Times, the Wall Street Journal editorial page,etc... Even liberal outlets like the New York Times and Washington Post have many conservative commentators- William Safire, Charles Krauthammer, etc...  I think it's safe to say that the Washington Post has far more conservative writers than the Washington Times has liberal writers. The obvious fact is that the media is far less monolithic than Coulter would have you believe. Coulter is so determined to make the media into a left-wing demon that she makes the preposterous claim that William Safire and Bill O'Reilly are not conservatives. This may be the weakest part of the book. As for the argument that O'Reilly is not a conservative because she opposes the death penalty, I could with equal absurdity claim that Bill Clinton was a conservative because he supported the death penalty. Many leftists, as dogmatic as Coulter, argued in the 90s that Clinton was not a liberal. This was, of course, absurd- but no more so than Coulter's analysis of Safire and O'Reilly.   Another big weakness of the book is Coulter's propensity to engage in ad hominem attacks. Yes, I know many liberals do it as well, but that doesn't make it right. The personal attacks add nothing to the substance of the book. The ad hominem attacks are especially out of place in a book that criticizes leftists for making personal attacks on conservatives (which they certainly do, too frequently).   It's too bad the author is so biased. The book had some very good arguments and could have been a lot better.I'm still hoping someone will write an equally passionate book that has more objectivity and less name-calling. I'm afraid, though, the author of this book won't be Ann Coulter. [...]
A2U723LLPV2A8A	June 29, 2002	1.0	Like the majority of reasonable Americans, I am neither "liberal" nor "conservative". Finishing this book, I am thankful for that. Upon completion, I realized that this book was a propaganda campaign for Coulter's shrill, smug, elitist, lopsided, and hypocritical views, with no capacity for thinking with both sides of the brain, and possessing the intellectual density of mayonnaise. She apparently believes that the person with the biggest mouth and most obnoxious ad hominem attacks automatically wins the argument. Where have we seen this behavior before? The book promotes "Ann Coulter", and that is all. There are no thoughtful essays, here. No interesting ruminations or insightful perceptions on the nuances of life. It has No ideas. It is full of dead pages. Conservatives will love it. Liberals will hate it. And the rest of us will continue to go about our lives wondering if there are any reasonably intelligent political pundits left in the arena who are worth listening to.
A30VISLN3S795D	September 24, 2002	5.0	ets cut right to the chase. this book pulls no punches and is going to make the anti republican, liberal , poverty pimpers in to the left want to cry,holler, stamp their feet and do everything to shout out the opposition. This is the tactic the left has used to make its point. The author gives a true and accurante rendition of the left and how they have tried to shut out free thinking in our nation. Coulter pulls no punches and gives examples of how the left  has used lies and deception and of course the bias that they supposedly so strongly fight against. As a former now member, Animal Rights Activist and Jesse Jackson supporter. I can atest to the sleazy underbelly that ms. coulter  so candidly exposes. This book will raise questions for any free thinking American. The media has labeled it propoganda from the right. I will give the left this much credit, Ms. Coulter is right.

A379X5TF53MZIJ	June 28, 2002	2.0	Ann, Ann, Ann. I'll definitely have some cheese with this "whine".  Since she got fired from the National Review the poor girl must have a little too much time on her hands. One would hope that she might focus on something important (like the fact that the stock market's in the dumps due chiefly to accounting shenanigans by her Republican friends on Wall Street) rather than churn out drivel like this. I had hoped these kind of low-rent political books would've gone out of style with the passing of the Clinton Presidency. I guess it's too much to expect the neo-cons to take the high road...David Brock was right. All is not lost, however. I'm giving it 2 stars for its entertainment value. I haven't laughed so hard in a long time. I'm also looking forward to Sean Hannity's one-dimensional take on "what's wrong with this country" in August
A3CMWDIJ6I4PGD	January 23, 2003	4.0	Let's put this book into perspective. Coulter is a polemicist and "Slander" is a right-wing hit piece; a very funny right wing hit piece. This is a right-wing version of "Stupid White Men" by Michael Moore. It's meant more to entertain than inform. All rightists and most intelligent leftists know the "maintsream" media leans left. Coulter just puts it into a funny perspective. Even leftists with a sense of humor might enjoy this book.  WARNING: If you are a leftist that sees every joke and jab at your expense as "offensive" better not read this. It will probably put you in the hospital. On the downside, the voliminous footnotes makes the reader think, "Gee, what a weighty tome." but the style is in which Coulter employs those footnotes is sloppy at best. Even without double checking the references I can guess than some of these quotes were taken out of context.  Read "Slander" for the sarcastic biting humor, NOT as some sort of deep public policy material.
A3DWUM6SN3N3NR	April 2, 2003	2.0	Physical beauty, articulate - but often meaningless - speech, and blonde hair do not compensate for such nuggets of anti-wisdom as: "Liberals have been wrong about everything in the last half century." Surprise news flash! A conservative being shocking and sensationalistic! Wow! How novel.  For starters, liberals were right about pollution in Houston decades before the GOP there would admit anything! To spend money on this book which is just as easy to skim through, then wipe with at your local library (which wouldn't exist without "liberals") is a horrible and unjustified utilization of these pages. Sinking hard-earned money (middle class liberals, read "harder") into this book is not nearly as appealing as muting the TV and watching the author move in silence. Beauty becomes beast quite quickly in this era of bigot-worship. On the up side, she looks a heck of a lot better than O-Reilley and at least seems to have more brain power. Ahhh, if only she could utilize it better.
A3FM0PAT23VTNA	October 13, 2002	3.0	The best parts of SLANDER occur when Ann Coulter sticks to the facts. I always welcome receiving intriguing information about such topics as voting patterns or PAC contributions. The rest of the book seems very repetitious as if there is no need to divide it into chapters except to allow the reader to come up for air.
A3HHS2O8AETNJI	December 26, 2002	5.0	Coulter's machine gun nest is well placed on top of the hill.  The bad guys are pinned down and there's nothing they can do.  The facts are the facts, blasting into the liberal infrastructure with precision, panache and hilarity.  Some of the last-gasp stooges, devasted by the assault, grasp at straws to find something that's not 100% absolutely proven.  But the damage is done.  The Emperor is naked on prime-time, though still posing like he's dressed in the Versace's latest showstopper.   For the first time since the advent of TV and the modern, left-wing media, the lies of the left are being exposed in a way that is observable by Joe and Betty Sixpack.  Coulter's readable, funny book, in conjunction with fair and balanced news disemination from Fox News plus 15 years of Rush Limbaugh and those that followed him, is taking large hunks out of what little credibility remains of "populist" ideology, and them that preach it.  Coulter reveals, through the computer miracle of Lexis/Nexis search, smoking gun, DNA, fingerprint and caught-on-camera proof of liberal (mainstream) media collusion in news mis-reporting.  The book is so overwhelming the only real reaction the left can have is to try their best to ignore it.  Send a copy to your favorite liberal NOW and wish them a very Happy New Year. "...I love the smell of napalm in the morning!"
A3L4B16UWD4D02	June 29, 2002	4.0	Most people in the Democratic Party and those in the left have no idea how tained the media is showing only their viewpiont and distorts the conservative side.  Whether you're a liberal or conservative, you ought to support an unbiased media!!!!  Ann points out that over 90% of the Washington bureau chiefs voted for Clinton in the last election, which is far greater than the Registered Democrat population, if that doesn't show liberal bias in the media, I am not sure what will. This book displays not only her viewpoints but also her witty personality!  Most liberals are offended by her and this book because it shows them what their party leaders are doing to themselves -- how the left are using the poor as their weapon to attack conservatives, by throwing out meaningless "tax cuts for ONLY the poor" and flaunts their superior monetary power from the liberal left by telling people that they LOVE paying taxes, because they can afford it.  The all "inclusive" party has been torn to threads by Ms. Coulter.  She may look cute on the cover, but she has that rare passion and fire inside of her that would, as she puts it, "make the strong men cringe and weak men who became Democrats".
A3L4B16UWD4D02	June 27, 2002	3.0	Ann Coulter is the definitive Republican conservative.  No matter if you hate her for what she believes in, she is a conservative who would stand up to the liberal media and tells what she thinks, rather than to tell what other people want her to think.  I don't agree with her 100% (more of a libertarian than a Republican) but what is she saying that isn't true?  Aren't liberals against guns?  I have yet to see a TV anchor who would report news fairly and without bias.  Instead of blaming the perpetrator for gun violence, it's always the guns fault but i have never heard them yap about banning knives when people use knives to commit violent crimes. She could use less inflammatory languages and that's why she gets a 3 star :)  I don't agree with her stance on Christianity and I don't think that all Founders are Christians (certainly not Thomas Jefferson who said Christianity distorts the truth that Jesus was preaching and that started with Paul, and that the contrast between Jesus's words and those that corrupted it (Paul, John, Mark, etc.) is comparable to diamonds in a dung hill), but it is really refreshing to see a conservative book for a change.
A3M8W5GJ2CESO9	June 28, 2002	5.0	As I read most of the previous reviews posted here, I saw a great deal of fear and hatred of the author, mingled with insults against her intelligence, and just plain nonsense (one reviewer accused her of wanting to form a "right-wing junta" and start executions of intellectuals!) That such vacuous nonsense is viewed by some as legitimate political discourse proves Ann's point for her, again and again!
A3ON9BMKFYSUHW	July 13, 2002	1.0	This book is a perfect example why the conservative movement will always be a minority movement in America.  It is impossible to prove your case when your argument is based on distortions and lacking in factual information.  First, the book is poorly written.  It was obviously targeted to appeal to the lower end of the IQ level, i.e., those who worship Rush Slimbaugh.  Second, the book suffers from the same problem as Fox News in that it presents information without bothering to even attempt to be fair and balanced.  It is as though she knows that her argument is so weak that she is unable to rely on a presentation of factual information.  If anyone is sincerely interested in an honest assessment of the media, they can read Professor Edward Herman's definitive book, "The myth of the liberal media".  This book documents ALL its material with case studies and relevant examples.  Also, a person seeking the truth about the media can also subscribe to the Nieman Reports which is published by the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University.  Be forewarned though that the Summer edition which exposes the failure of the fourth estate in reporting on the Enron scandal is very depressing!
A3P7GYZQXT0QNK	July 7, 2002	4.0	There is much good information in Coulter's book, but it is not always presented in the most effective ways.  While the book is funny (if not witty) and incisive with a large number of citations, Coulter tends to edge around her points, driving the same issues home time and time again with little regard for the structure of the book or the arguments she is trying to make.  It's not until the chapter on the Fox News Channel and its "role" in the 2000 election that she truly hits her stride and figures out how to make real life events as exciting as a potboiler novel, but up to that point, Slander is a difficult, meandering read.  It should, however, be considered required reading for all conservatives in the United States, and while I'd not hesitate to recommend that all liberals read it as well, there's a strong chance that despite its 800 citations and generous dose of common sense, it would not serve to convince them of Coulter's thesis.  Those who can more readily identify with the issues posed by Coulter will more readily be persuaded.
A3QLN8ZGVQWI3V	July 8, 2002	1.0	ADDENDUM 7-12-02: NOTE TO THOSE WHO ASSUME I HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK; You are correct- I didn't spend a cent on the book; it's available at my library. You are incorrect to say that I didn't read it. You are also incorrect to say that I didn't refer to it's content in the review: I count at least three specific references to content in what is a very short review. Might I suggest that you are projecting your own behavior when you make such assumptions about others? Now, here's what I think of it: Coulter's use of ad hominem attack and downright falsification would qualify this work as slanderous, were her subjects not public figures and hence unable to sue under New York Times v. Sullivan, one of the great liberal decisions of our time that protects her right to liken a morning talk show host with whom she disagrees to Eva Braun, and then in a calculated "backstep", to Joseph Goebbels. This book represents more of the same crying -- or howling-- wolf that the right has perfected. The former tobacco industry apologist who has made a name for herself not through accomplishment in any tangible sense, but rather through making herself into a product and then getting placed, continues the tired routine of whining about how biased "the media" is, in an age where liberal voices have been all but silenced in the torrent of right wing opinion mongering on radio, cable and network news. A movement that fancies itself intellectually viable ought to think twice before embracing a person who views Pat Robertson as insufficiently conservative, as Coulter does in this lightweight doodle.
A3SMXJOSGLGVUP	June 30, 2002	5.0	Ann Coulter's premise in this book is that American liberals are not interested in political dialogue or honest debate. They are interested in destroying the reputations and public personas of conservatives through lies, fear-mongering and outright slander.  Karl Marx once wrote, "Criticism is not a scalpel, but a weapon.  Its object is the enemy, whom it wishes not to refute but to destroy." Borrowing a page from Marx, liberals and their enthusiastic accomplices in the major media regularly imply or state outright that Republicans are dangerous, racist, anti-democratic and intolerant.  Thus supposedly responsible Democratic sources have stated that that Newt Gingrich was involved in "race-based, anger charged politics," Judge Bork would bring back "segregated lunch counters," and Tom DeLay is "the meanest man in Congress."  If you are a Republican woman, the personal attacks become even more venemous and hateful, attacking the looks of these women in order to destroy them psychologically.  Thus Linda Tripp looks like "Howard Stern in a fright wing,"  Katherine Harris "applies her makeup with a trowel."  Paula Jones and Lucianne Goldberg were also beneficiaries of this kind of liberal "sensitivity and tolerance." Coulter uses the LexisNexis database and search engine to compile overwhelming statistics and facts to prove her point, and her point is this:  modern politics is a hateful enterprise, and liberals have made it that way.  Since they have controlled the major media for the past twenty years or more, liberals simply have no need for honest debate, and no proclivity whatever for simple civility.  Indeed, they are ruthless, win-at-all costs, and increasingly Machiavellian. If you are a conservative or a Republican, this book will sicken you.  Bernard Goldberg told us that the media is liberal biased, but the problem is much worse than mere bias.  The problem involves a major campaign of lying, slander, fear-mongering and personal destruction for any whose politics do not coincide with the liberal catechism.
A3TMH3ESKQN3L4	October 16, 2002	3.0	I have seen or heard Ann Coulter interviewed many times, and I picked up this book in hopes of reading a lot more of her wit and her straight forward style.  This book has neither her humour or straight forward style. This book is more of an "In your face" style. It's true that she has 36 pages of footnotes to doccument her quotes and comments. However; this books "in your face" style will be enjoyed by conservatives, but any open minded liberal will become quickly offended and put the book down in disgust and believe the book is more hate mongering by Republicans. In my opinion she should have offered her book AFTER removing MANY of the phrases that cause knee jerk reactions with liberals. Unfortunately; this book sheds more heat than light. Two Bears.
A3VHW9PESLU9RB	February 13, 2003	3.0	This is, like most recent books on politics, an obvious case of preaching to the choir. If you want to see liberals get trashed, it doesn't get much better than this. Most books of this genre seem to come from radio talk show hosts and it shows in the writing, which is often chatty and lacking in depth (as if their authors, befitting their trade, simply dictated the text into a microphone) but Coulter is a skilled writer and it shows. This is PJ O'Rourke on PMS, and when she sharpens her poison pen, look out! This book is loaded with zingers, early on we get this about the war on terror: "Here the country had finally given liberals a war against fundamentalism and they didn't want to fight it. They would have, except it would have put them on the same side as the United States." For 205 pages Coulter launches a relentless attack on the Left, focusing the bulk of her ire on the liberal media. She makes many of the same points as Bernard Goldberg does in "Bias", only she does so with considerably more gusto. People who are tired of feeling that the media elites sneer at them and their values will find much to like here, she channels their anger and focuses it like a laser beam on her targets. Their vacuousness, mendacity, and one-sidedness are exposed for all to see.   Of course, much of her book simply backs up pre-existing views. The notion that the media tilts left is hardly new; she simply provides evidence to back it up. If nothing else, she certainly didn't slack off when it came to research, the book contains something like 800 footnotes, so it's obvious that she did her homework. It is enlightening to learn, for example, that conservative authors vastly outsell books by liberals, yet publishers routinely offer the latter much larger advances, the implication being that publishers are willing to let ideology trump basic business sense. And she performs the valuable service of debunking the notion that the success of Rush Limbaugh and other conservative pundits are "proof" of a lack of media bias because this fails to make the distinction between the "opinion" media versus the "hard news" media. After all, Rush and his ilk make no bones about their political leaning whereas liberals like Dan Rather insist on calling themselves "objective" when they simply aren't. All in all, Coulter, like the lawyer she is, argues a convincing case. Of course, the counter to this book is to say that, as an author playing the role of advocate, it's obvious she's only doing what a good lawyer does, namely argue the best case for her cause, which naturally means that only facts that support her point of view will be given.  Informed readers will take that as a given, and judge accordingly. The down side, however, is this means authors like Coulter (and left wing counterparts like Mike Moore) simply contribute, not enlightenment, but further polarization. Coulter's acerbic wit is quite capable of becoming shrill, even bitter at times. Her fans love her for this, but in addition to antagonizing her foes, she also runs the risk of alienating centrists who might otherwise be persuaded to see things her way. In contrast, readers of Bernard Goldberg's "Bias" are also presented with a strong case for the notion of liberal bias in the media, but he's much less strident and he's willing to appeal to both moderates and liberals.  The other night he was on Hardball with Chris Matthews doing a live show on a college campus. With a combination of facts and solid arguments delivered with a serious, yet pleasant, demeanor, he worked the crowd like the media pro he is. The audience, which was mostly young and liberal, listened respectfully to his points. He may not have changed many people's minds outright, but I'll bet more than a few students at least will give the matter some thought. In contrast, it's a fair bet that, had Coulter been on that show instead, she would have succeeded primarily in convincing the majority of that audience to reject her views while winning little, if any, support.
A5LYQUIU2WYC5	October 3, 2002	4.0	If you want to read an all out bashing on liberalism this book does the job, and then some! Conservatives will love,  absolutely love the way democrates and the liberal media are presented in this book. You'll be amazed how liberal the media really are and points out who these people with a liberal agenda other than reporting the news are. The book will open your eyes on how bias the media really is with the exception of the fox news channel. Great book!
A97SC5LJZEORV	January 21, 2003	1.0	I didn't expect insight from Ann Coulter, but I did expect to be entertained.  As one of a trio of shreiking blondes, she enlivened the TV pundit scene during the impeachment era.  (She reminded me of a kid in a big family who has to resort to being outrageous to get attention.)  But "Slander" is silly, and without Ms. Coulter to emote her words, boring. Well researched and footnoted?  Puh-lease!  If I'd turned in such a paper to my eighth grade teacher, I'd have been lucky to get a D.      I give Coulter credit for being shrewd.  It appears that she knew there was an audience for such drivel, and had no scruples against capitalizing on it.  No doubt she's made a lot of money on "Slander."  I'm just REAL sorry part of that money came out of my pocket.  Don't make the same mistake.  This book isn't worth your time, let alone your money.
ABZURZQ6OBQSD	December 7, 2002	5.0	Ann Coulter's brilliant conceit--and it's a conceit that seems over the head of certain reviewers--is her writing is a vehicle meant to provoke.  Much like free-style rappers come up with outrageous lines to show down their opponents in verse, Ann Coulter drops lyrical bombs meant less to offer incisive critique on the great issues of the day than to humorously point out the abject illogic of the liberal position in today's world.  If you take her work as anything more than that--if you assume that she aims to be the Socrates of Hegel of our time--you will be sorely disappointed.  Her aim here is not critical thought or substantive thought but rather to embarras liberals. Witness one paragraph of her book, from page 20 of the hardcover edition: "At the risk of helping liberals formulate more persuasive arguments, there are a few pointers that might help them upgrade from the overheated demagogic rhetoric of fanatical cult members...."Nazi" can be used properly in a sentence, but it tends to lose its sting when you call every Republican a Nazi....Using the same words to describe school vouchers as to characterize the Holocaust tends to leave the impression that you forgot your point." All in all, hers is a brillaint method aimed at exposing the naive simplicity with which the reactionary left rails against those that wish to preserve our liberties.
AEEJ27PAKC3NK	July 12, 2004	1.0	The maxim "Know Your Enemy" holds weight here.  Coulter clearly doesn't know her enemy (anything left of her own thoughts are automatically "liberal") and doesn't at all know what she's talking about.  Read one chapter, then research her footnotes, carefully.  You'll find, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that she distorted and taken out of context quotes from the public record.  Her next follow-up book should be titled: "Libel: An Autobiography."

AESFBWLI3KDDU	July 1, 2002	1.0	Ann Coulter and her upholding of Traditional American Values?  Define "Traditional American Values."  And for whom are they to be allocated?  Those who conform to the widely accepted social and political mores of the times?  The Constitution in its original conception was a remarkably liberal document that got skewed by Republicanism over the past two centuries.  I don't see how I can possibly rate postively a book that represents the glorificaion of an American Dream that has ceased to exist and the antithesis of what "democracy" SHOULD be - this endorsement of white supremacy, social homogeneity, and heterosexism.  Books like this leave me disturbed and disgusted at how how little things seem to have changed.  And heightens my own passion for social activism and public service - so I can exercise MY own American right to deconstruct this kind of hegemonic discourse...
AI37YX1U4KB1L	February 17, 2003	5.0	As the Leftist Bill Maher states on the back of the book, "The conservative movement has found its diva."  I couldn't agree more.  Although she's a woman, and a fine one at that, she has more balls(and intelligence) than college dropout liberal Michael Moore and all of the other liberal pundit demagogues combined. "Liberals dispute slight reductions in the tax rate as if they are trying to prevent Charles Manson from slaughtering baby seals."  Coulter takes no prisoners in Slander as she unabashedly & indiscriminately slams all pretenders and contenders with a refreshing candor and humorous intellect rarely witnessed in today's insipid Leftist liberally-biased media.  This book is a must have for all conservatives.  Funny, engaging, and educational ammo to fend off the pesky bed-wetting liberals.
AI6JFG9Y5DI6E	May 21, 2003	4.0	Ann Coulter does a fantastic job of conveying the many reasons that the media inherently does not like conservative politicians.   In her book, Ann masterfully disects and exposes the fraudulent claims of a neutral stance in today's media.  Her thorough research shows that the media jumps at the opportunity to slam conservative politicians while making every excuse in the book to praise liberals.  Even if it means being a hypocrite.   While Ann can sometimes be a bit verbose in her writings, her book never fails to keep you turning pages.  At the very least, you'll walk away with a new respect for this extremely talented lady, and a slight suspicion of your local news anchor(s).
ARLEYGLXN94KE	October 19, 2003	5.0	A very revealing and thought-provoking book.  Having read it and read the 'reviews' of it, lets take some of Anne's philosophy and run with it...CHALLENGE HER FACTS!  Please don't use cliche-garbage phrases like 'Right-Wing Conspiracy', 'Clinton-bashing', 'Ditto-heads', 'it's all lies', and so on.  Please just say 'yes' or 'no' as to whether the accusations in this book are valid.     I don't want to hear about how great things were economically under Clinton, (mind you, I have no idea what Clinton did to deserve credit for the economy, other than just being in office at the right time,) or 'it's all about sex'...I merely want to know is what she says the truth,  and if it's not, than what is?      The only fault I can find in her writing is sometimes she gets a bit too passionate about some items in the book.  It's great to finally see someone who cares, though...and to get another perspective on current events other than the mainstream media.      Keep it up, Anne!  We love you!
ATHF0LZ7IAFKB	July 9, 2002	4.0	This book will be appreciated by people for whom facts, logic, evidence and reason mean something. The left won't like it or even read it, so they will miss out on the following example of "Coulterian" humor: ""Even Islamic terrorists don't hate America like liberals do...If they had that much energy, they'd have indoor plumbing by now." For years, the biased, lying hypocrites who comprise the leftist news media have used a juvenile technique that is patently obvious to any conservative (i.e., adults.) When accused of liberal bias, they engage in the diversionary tactic of producing ostensibly legitimate complaints from other listeners, readers, or viewers complaining of a "conservative" bias in the news industry.  This gives the general public the false impression that a particular news organ (or the industry in general) is fair, impartial, and actively resisting "extremists" of both stripes. This practice worked well until the advent of Lexis/Nexis which permits subscribers to empirically test allegations of news media bias by quantifying them. This Ms. Annie has done, and the left isn't going to appreciate her efforts in doing so. Ms. Annie has proved beyond any reasonable doubt that the "elite" media is a hive of leftists, hypocrites and un-American traitors who, despite much lip service to the contrary, don't believe in the First Amendment any more than they believe in tax cuts. Indeed, in hundreds of examples and in dozens of contexts, Ms. Coulter illustrates the viciousness and hysteria that characterizes the news media's response to challenges to its near-monopoly power. They are dug-in like the 101st Airborne at Bastogne. This book should be read by any thinking person, if for no other reason than her description of the left's attempted coup following the Presidential Election of November, 2000.
AVGGEAI1YGSAP	September 24, 2002	5.0	Myself: The biases of a reviewer are very important in judging a review of a book of this nature, so here are mine. I am a libertarian because the classical word liberal used to describe Thomas Jefferson has been hijacked by the Democrats, who only believe in affording me liberty when I agree with their agenda. The Republican Party has plenty wrong with it too, and looks good only when compared to the alternative. I believe in limited government, maximum individual freedom and peaceful coexistence through minding our own business, staying strong and eradicating terrorists. In the words of that immortal song, GOD BLESS THE USA.   THE BOOK: As my rating indicates, I found this a very enjoyable and informative book. The subtitle, "Liberal Lies About The American Right",  accurately conveys the book's thesis. The voluminous footnotes (almost 1000) more than adequately illustrate her points.(Any reveiwer who says that she does not document her case is either totally biased or hasn't read the book.) SLANDER begins with an overview of Miss Coulter's viewpoint and then examines the media coverage and liberal viewpoints regarding several issues such as John McCain's presidential campaign, the adolation and subsequent vicious attacks on Bob Packwood as the liberals' agenda changed, the Clinton impeachment fiasco (regardless of which side you were on), and best of all, the coverage of the 2000 presidential campaigns by Bush and Gore and the subsequent Florida election brouhaha. And she does a wonderful job of showing how the media treatment of George W Bush changed in the patriotic fervor that followed the events of 9/11. Her well deserved prime example is the New York Times, which she credits in her introduction with making the book possible because of the target rich opportunity which they provide. She also illustates the many examples of the liberal supporters of free speech and art trying to suppress through such devices as campus speech codes opinions and political speech with which they do not agree. The author's insights combine with rapier like phraseolgy to skewer the opposition, and she puts her linguistic skills to excellent use. In fact, one of my few criticisms is that occasionally she gets carried away by her own hyperbole, an accusation which she frequently makes regarding her adversaries. Also, the frequency of the footnotes is almost overwhelming; yet I felt they should be read because many additional information regarding the referenced subject and I am a political junkie interested in all the details. As the title hopefully makes clear, this is a book with a point of view and not an attempt to provide a balanced study of the subject. But it is required reading for anyone who either agrees with the point of view or is simply interested in it.
AYJNY01NFTVX3	February 21, 2003	1.0	Ms. Coulter is not exactly telling the truth (lying is such a dirty word) with this book, therefore, I think it would be best if this were located in fiction. The true slander of this book is Ms. Coulter's personal vendetta against all liberals and democrats. She is spreading lies and falsehoods to make herself look better. (Her comments have been publicly questioned and debated on several tv talk shows.) Ms. Coulter is also a racist and has made public comments about how America should conquer all the nations of the world and convert the people to Christianity. Her intolerance is very alarming and disgusting. Quite frankly, women as hatefilled as Ms. Coulter scare me. Though I understand Ms. Coulter has a First Amendment right to "Freedom of Speech". She is allowed to voice her opinion, no matter how dangerous it might be. That is her right, but that doesn't mean that people should read it. So, please, people...avoid this woman who is spreading her hatred and filth. Read something that won't inspire you to go blow up an abortion clinic or a mosque...please!
AYJNY01NFTVX3	January 23, 2003	1.0	Ms. Coulter is not exactly telling the truth with this book, therefore, I think it would be best if this were located in fiction.  The true slander of this book is Ms. Coulter's personal vendetta against all liberals and democrats.  She is spreading lies and falsehoods to make herself look better.  With people like her and books like these, there will always be fighting between liberals and conservatives.  Why?  Well, she's a person who likes to provoke them by lying.  My best advice is not to buy this book...ever!
A15NS9ERV7LT7A	June 30, 2002	4.0	Slander is often brilliant: painstakingly researched, witty, and often making its case with breathtaking power. But it's also  flawed: to make her case that liberals and the  news media demonize conservatives, author Ann Coulter consistently demonizes THEM. It's a shame because Coulter often makes her case but resorts to the same tactics and language that she's criticizing.  After you read it you wonder: then, what was the point?      She contends our political discourse increasingly resembles "professional wrestling," yet uses that exact style when writing about individuals and groups who she often effectively demolishes with facts. For instance, how does calling former CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite a "pious left-wing blowhard" make our political discussion more issue oriented -- even if it IS INCREDIBLY funny (which it is) and may indeed be true (I would not be a bit surprised)?      If you are a conservative Republican (I am not) you will LOVE Slander and want to gift it to like-minded friends. If you are a liberal Democrat (I am not) you will HATE Slander and not finish it. If you're an independent (like me) you may feel sad since Coulter, an attorney,  at times makes her case so well. But her slash-and-burn rhetoric turns Slander into a case of the pot calling the pot a pot.  She makes many points with wit, such as on how New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was demonized by liberals until 911: "After September 11, the average New Yorker faced a risk of death or bodily harm not seen since David Dinkins was mayor...The characterization of Giuliani as a heartless brute vanished into thin air like the blather it always was."     ABC's hiring of former Clinton aide George Stephanopoulous, she writes, is "the equivalent of a major network hiring Chuck Colson immediately after Watergate."     Coulter did her homework well, using extensive quotations, facts and statistics to bolster her case on several points. A few of the many: --An overall defense of Fox News Network and what happened on its election night reporting. --The number of high-profile Democrats who left politics to work in the news media's upper echelons. She names names --  and  it's DEVASTATING. --How opponents constantly characterize conservatives as stupid and link them with things related to Nazis to spread fear and activate their own political base. --Media and liberals' exaggeration and misinformation about the Religious Right's actual power and alleged  "threat". --How the media use "ultra" and "far"-right labels on conservatives but neglect to use these words, or even  "liberal" on Democrats. This is her most devastating knock-out punch, using precise LexisNexis search statistics. She effectively PROVES bias. --How liberals, feminists and the news media have ignored and ridiculed  conservative author and activist Phyllis Schlafly's considerable education, accomplishments and ideas. This is among her strongest sections.   Yet, this section points out Coulter's problem: to boost Schlafly she simply cannot resist attacking feminist Gloria Steinem who, she writes, "had to sleep with Mort Zuckerman, a rich liberal media mogul" to keep the magazine Ms. afloat. This is elevating political discussion??     Her weakest contention: she writes of conservative women being branded as ugly by liberals adding: "Only conservative women have their looks held up to ridicule because only liberals would be so malevolent."  Patently FALSE: conservatives have ridiculed Janet Reno, Chelsea Clinton, and others for their looks and conservative talk show hosts still liken Clinton administration cabinet women to the bar scene in Star Wars (by the way I love ALL this ridicule and hope it continues...but we are talking about what's FACTUAL here).      Elsewhere, she writes: "Liberals have been wrong about everything in the last half-century" while "conservatives in America are the most tolerant and long suffering people in the world...If a conservative calls you stupid, you are stupid...Liberal lie even when they call people names."      Coulter is definitely on the right track with Slander. Her writing, research and theme are topnotch. Slander WILL sell  -- but its impact will be greatly reduced by its author's  nuclear-attack mode execution which, in the end, undermines its credibility.
A164H5JG1QSRKS	June 29, 2002	5.0	The same strategy that will win the war on terrorism can win the war against the left: Namely, giving back to the terrorists 10 times what they hit us with. Bloody a bully's nose, and the bully will run away crying. Ann Coulter understands this, and this is the tack she takes in this book. With profuse footnotes, Coulter shines the bright light of truth on the dominant media cockroaches and their clients on the political left. It is an unrelenting bare-knuckle slugfest that is a delight to read....if you are a conservative. Coulter takes the words of the dominant leftist media (The New York Times and the 3 major TV networks are the most frequent targets) and turns them against them, exposing a breathtaking pattern of deceit and mendacity that will be shocking to the uninitiated. To veterans of the war for the truth, it is a much-needed exlixhir that reminds us that our enemy has no shame and cares nothing for the truth when it interferes (as it almost ALWAYS does) with their utopian vision of an Orwellian America. The sheer weight and breadth of Coulter's sources dispel any notion that this book is just a vicious diatribe. It is loaded with ammunition for soldiers of the truth to go back out onto the field of battle with. The very words of the most "respected" stars of the radical left are used to pummel them into oblivion. It is a quick and fun read, and you will find yourself shaking your head in disbelief at the sheer audacity of the mainstream media as their concerted and sometimes coordinated schemes against the truth are exposed. We on the right can learn a great deal from the approach of Ann Coulter: No more Mr. Nice Guy! Ann Coulter is as mad as hell, as should be anyone who seeks the truth, and truth-seekers will be armed to the teeth after they take a dose of Coulter's high-octane elixhir.
A164H5JG1QSRKS	June 28, 2002	5.0	Ann Coulter is anything but subtle....and this is exactly what is needed to fend off the vicious attacks of radical leftists on what remains of a once-great republic. As in the war on terrorism, the Right needs to heed the strategy that will ultimately conquer terror:Namely, getting in and brawling with the liars, bullies and cowards who hide behind platitudes and fiction and propaganda.  Ann Coulter leads the way for others to follow. This is a take-no-prisoners, bare-knuckle, wade in and slug away bloodbath, with the pinko left on the receiving end of an unrelenting pummelling. It is a delight to read. It is a quick but very deep read. There are profuse footnotes from a wide variety of sources. But Coulter is most effective when turning the weapons of the left against the left: Countering lies with truth, hysteria and emotion with reason and calm. The effect is devastating, and it is a shot of adrenaline for any member of the "silent majority" that may be getting weary in the war for the soul of America.  Lead the way, Ann, and TAKE NO PRISONERS!!
A16CK7NXLHO4KN	June 27, 2002	1.0	I still wonder what was Ann Coulter's point in writing this book.  The material here isn't new or insightful.  After reading this book, I came away from it wondering what kind of America she wants.  Well, it is an America where her view of morality, ethics, and public policy reigns supreme, with little regard to what the people want. To be fair, the documentation in the book is pretty good.  However, it is lost in the shuffel of her pandering to the right-wing of the country.  Her complaints about the liberal media are right out of the 1980s.  While she talks a good line about the media being shills for the Democratic party (a questionable claim at best), she glosses over the fact that talk radio is almost completely dominated by conservatives. As I finished the book, I thought about what her goal was.  The book reads as a position paper that she hopes will forever catapult her into history as one of the prime lieutenants of the conservative movement, if not one of the prime movers and shakers.  What she failed to understand is that books like this, with its pandering and take-no-prisoners tone, will pass into oblivion or become the source for humor on late-night television.
A1ADZM3L9G6K68	November 14, 2002	1.0	What is it with these arrogant, wealty, well-supported belly-achers bleating out against those who try to offer even modest ideas for some form of social fairness?  Is it not bad enough that we see the power of unprecedented privilege lurking in every corner, reeking in every media rag? Do we also have to put up with the cacaphony of a would-be Playboy pull-out complaining of unspeakable injustices to the rich? Or of the heinous criminality of those who would try to ask civil questions?  The lady puts on quite a show.  But this contraption called an author cannot be taken seriously by anyone with half a brain or a modicum of conscience.  Except she is, in a nasty-spirited, unthinking, even unChristlike, gluttonous age.  O tempore, o mores.  Shame, shame, sick, sick, ick, ick, ....  Enough time wasted on the oportunistic sewer-mouth, already. I guess it passes, fittingly, for contemporary intellectuality.
A1B5AA6IVXDR9R	July 16, 2002	5.0	In this hilariously entertaining book, Ann Coulter devotes an entire chapter to the left wing assault on the "religious right" - code words for white southerner.  After a lifetime of seeing white southerners ridiculed in Hollywood and on television by the towering intellects of the left, she had me laughing out loud at these Calhounish buffoons.   Right on, Ann!
A1GALZCXD8FHOR	November 7, 2002	4.0	Writing with the cajones so many other commentators lack, Coulter goes right for the leftist jugular, sinking her well-sharpened fangs in its flabby neck. Laser-like in its focus, "Scandal" scrutinizes the leftist bias in the news from a true conservative's viewpoint, further expanding on the basic theme of Goldberg's "Bias". Rather than rehash what many reviewers have already noted, I'll stick to what is most compelling. Coulter makes her case on several topics and provides details rarely heard or seen elsewhere. For one, I was not aware at the incredible time differences of the news outlets in calling states for Gore and calling them for Bush in the 2000 election. Without fail, they rushed to call states for Gore and held off calling them for Bush (even though the Bush states were less close between the two candidates.) Coulter also thoroughly dismantles the "Christian right" voting bloc construct so often cited by the liberals who run the media by showing less common ground in right-wing voting patterns than in those of the liberal  left.  Others have noted that Coulter stoops to namecalling and some of the dirty tricks she accuses liberals of using. There is a distinction, however, that is being forgotten. Coulter claims that liberals say, "Bush is dumb," and they leave it at that. Coulter's namecalling takes more of the form "Gore is dumb because...." It's one thing to call your opponent a name, but it's entirely another to call them a name and then prove why that name is appropriate. Personally, I found this to be the book "Bias" was not: thought-provoking and well-written by an erudite insider. While I enjoyed her deft wording, most liberals will be unable to complete "Slander" simply because they cannot handle the multi-syllabic words. Still, the audience for this is a puzzler; if you are conservative, she preaches to the choir, and if you're not, well, you probably won't get past the first few pages without your head exploding. Amusing and witty throughout, "Slander" is a worthy bestseller and a compelling look at the leftist obfuscation in the news.
A1I6D0QZ5FK6L0	April 23, 2003	1.0	Ann Coulter has written a book that is so filppant with the facts that it loses all credibility.  She uses 'uban myths" of liberal avarice and sloth to craft an image of liberals as America-hating hippies.  The danger of this type of book is that whenever Coulter is pushed on the facts, she always falls back on the fact that it was really written as entertainment and to lighten up.  So which is it?  Entertainment or fact?  Doesn't matter, it fails miserably as either.
A1KIIGKPRKHP48	November 12, 2002	4.0	Required reading for any lion-hearted Aryan. From her unsubstantiated intimations of liberal conspiracies to her--and MY!--erotic fantasies of forced conversions amongst the Barbaric Horde, Coulter packs her typical punch!
A1MR1VMK999I6O	November 5, 2002	5.0	I admit that I prefer reading what Ms Coulter writes to listening to her.  She is a take no prisoner person and in many ways I respect that.  She is an unapologetic conservative who has firm beliefs. ...  I guess that is why I at least respect her.  And while I am not of her political persuasion I must admit she does her homework when she has a topic in mind and then she sets out to make her case.  And the book is timely and should be read by conservatives, moderates and liberals.
A1QL5Q7E13RDM3	July 3, 2002	5.0	Why 5 stars? Because I'm conservative, and this book appeals to my decidedly partisan political outlook. Let's be honest folks. None of us is really objective. We rate/vote/argue/whatever along ideological lines. Oh yeah, and the *other* side always makes it personal (goes without saying I suppose). Anyway, if you're conservative, you'll enjoy this book. If not, it'll [tick] you off.
A1R7Q10K5Y6Y63	June 28, 2002	5.0	If Ann Coulter is so off the mark, why is this book a best seller out of the gates?  Because Ms. Coulter offers insightful perspectives on the sad state of our perpetually liberally biased media, and how it has brainwashed the American public into believing that all conservatives are racist, heartless ogres...  And well done Ms. Coulter.
A1VHK9A4VLJTHC	December 1, 2002	5.0	I just finished my second reading through this book and I must say I'd love to sit down and actually talk with Ann Coulter, her wit and sense of humor are only shadowed by her ability to faithfully articulate logic in a debate.  She tears down walls of liberal arguments and asides and exposes the torrid of lies and slander that liberal celebrities and liberal journalists have been perpetrating on the American public for years. Any criticism channeled at this book that doesn't give multiple and specific examples explained in a coherent fashion is most likely from a liberal that hasn't read it but feels that they "know" it must be bad.  When it was first published most of the low ratings were simply from people calling Ann Coulter names (many of those reviews were eventually removed).   Coulter points out that this is how liberals debate, not just here reviewing books, but in the news, in magazines, on tv variety shows, etc., they call those they disagree with names.  They impute all types of horrors on  those they disagree with and provide the evidence by calling them "stupid", "dumb", "hate filled", "homophobes", "racists", or the worse of all "right wing Christian" a name which implies all the previous bromidic epithets rolled into one. She points out that all serious new ideas in the last fifty some years have come from the conservative side of the aisle.  Conservatives debate each other with actual ideas.  They don't always agree but at least they don't have to spin their wheels fighting nonsensical charges and trying to defend their character against lies from the left.  It takes a Tom Dashel to accuse Rush Limbaugh of inciting terrorist acts, but it takes conservative leaders to actually do something to fight terrorism. The most important chapter chronicled how liberals attack of the "Religious Right".  How the left has build itself a straw man to knock down again and again.  She chronicles how the left builds up this amazing force that is so powerful and dangerous.  And then notes how every few years the media will report how this same force is losing its power and grip.  I found it enlightening to read her description of how the left sees this great vast conspiracy they so fear (and expect the public to fear) contrasted with  reality. There is no organizational unit which can be called the "Right Wing".   There is no group to which any Christian can get a card to and thus be called a "card carrying member" of the "Religious Right".  In fact the very idea that Christians vote in bloc is shown by the data to be seriously flawed, blacks, hispanics, Jews, etc. voted in bloc to a much higher degree than do those that call themselves Christian.  Coulter shows the amounts of money donated in a particular year to PACs and it is clear that unions, lawyers and other special interest groups give far more money than any religious group does.  And funny thing, there is no donation going to the RNC from "The Religious Right Inc". I think my main compliant about this book is that the chapter on religion needs to be devoted to an entire book.  Coulter mentions in a few paragraphs about how the left has become a religion of its own and gives this as one of the reasons it fights so hard against conservatives, especially Christians.  I hope this subject can become the next book project she writes about.   The Atheist Left votes as a bloc but it isn't likely to be written about in the mainstream press. Much of the doctrine of the left is exposed in Slander.   Some things may very well be debatable, but with all the footnotes and documentation it is hard to argue that she is out in left field just making this stuff up.  I found this book to be very readable (the second time around was still enjoyable) it is filled with footnotes, quotes and lots of examples.   I give this book a strong recommendation.  Ann Coulter is funny, witty, smart and strong. And she tells it like it is.  The kind of woman that feminists can't help but hate.
A1YYAGD960GP1M	July 8, 2002	5.0	Excellent volume, overall, but the this excerpt from a recent interview with Katie Couric is relevant to the comment that I'd like to offer on this book: 'Ms. COULTER: Yes, a little bit more than that, and that is that political debate with liberals is basically impossible in America today because liberals are calling names while conservatives are trying to make arguments. And when every one of your arguments is characterized as an attempt to bring back slavery or resegregate lunch counters, it's a little hard to have any sort of productive debate." This is where Ms. Coulter fails to step up to the bar in the conclusion of her book. Having made that statement, she, like so many of us, refuses to see the elephant in the living room. And that is that we cannot live in the same society with those with this sort of mindset. At the foundation of the liberal worldview lies the absolute conviction that reason is no guide to action; that one cannot live by principle; that the truth does not matter, and that anything goes if it feels good. Liberals are not friends of liberty, justice and reason. Men of reason and good will can disagree, but for the most part, they are content to let reality be the final arbiter. Facts, reason, logic and a ruthless respect for the truth are the common currency of civilized individuals. The problem with liberals is that You can never simply shrug your shoulders and walk away if you happen to disagree. They'll clap a hand on your shoulder, spin you around and 'improve' your judgement with a gun in your face. Their implicit faith inthe notion of the ultimate malleability of human nature is all that's needed to justify the murderous sprees that have dominated the history of the last century. No mountain of corpses too high, no ocean of blood too deep when it comes to the perfection of the New Man.  Remember that the arguments of the left usually devolve into who can justify the most mass murder and tyranny. Liberals and their ilk all know that that's what it would take to realize their sick dreams of dominion over every sphere of human thought and endeavor. Worse, liberals demand that we applaud them for it. At the end of the day, what's left is open warfare. Time to stop deceiving ourselves.
A22LH21V5EZIOF	May 12, 2006	5.0	This book is very interesting, detailing many liberal hypocrisies. It is well-researched and well-written, with biting wit. I would highly recommend this book to those seeking detailed examples of media bias.
A27QBFLGAYAL5O	November 6, 2002	5.0	This book is fantastic.  I know it makes some of the other reviewers outraged because of the tone taken, but there are only so many ways you can sugar coat the truth.  She could have tried to just list the facts, but her points tie everything together!  She has woven a blanket of facts that have exposed the media.  Media convinces themselves that they don't have a bias.  I'm sure there are some well-meaning journalists out there.  But, the totality of the facts listed in this book makes it indisputable.  Excellent, well researched book!  ALL AMERICAN'S SHOULD READ THIS BOOK!
A2CA4N99HTUOIX	October 25, 2003	1.0	This is a quote from page 5 beginning at the bottom of the page.  "Liberals hate America,they hate "flag-wavers," they hate abortion opponents, they hate all religions except Islam (post 9/11).  Even Islamic terrorists don't hate America like liberals do...." Does anyone get the feeling that Ann Coulter hates liberals?  After reading that, I could barely go on, but I always give an author about 100 pages of my time.  I made it to page seventy of Ann's book, then I started to get a bad headache (I really did, and it lasted two days).  When the headache became a vague memory, I paged through to parts of the rest of the book that I thought I should read, such as her oppinion of the media. The hatred goes on.  Here's a  quote from page 70, paragragh 3: "yes, Walter Cronkite was a pious left-wing blowhard.  Molinari may have been a pro-choice "moderate Republican," but at least she was not Walter Cronkite.  Walter Cronkite, the man who helped bring the horror of the Vietnam war to us via television. Ann makes a huge case against the media for being left-wing biased.  I surmise the media is neither left or right; they're afraid because their jobs are on the line.  Why am I so sure of this?  Nobody is reporting and investigating The Bush administration's financial and friendly ties to Saudie Arabia and more specifically their ties to Osama Bin Laden (See the October, 2003 issue of Rolling Stone Magazine, Pg. 39, "George of Arabia").  Rather than spending our time reading books that espouse hatred,  we could spend that time and energy writing to the media and asking questions about the true motives of the current administrations policies.
A2DBCNFBM5WRAR	February 3, 2003	4.0	I couldn't wait to find buy this book.  I have seen Ann many times on different talk shows defending the conservative ideal aginst the onslaught of liberalism.  Often times she is the lone conservative going up against 2 or 3 loud mouth liberals and each time she defends her position well.  This book did not disapoint.  Many have trashed her as mean spirited.  But, when you read example after example of liberal bias, as pointed out in her book you begin to wonder where the mean spiritedness is.  As a conservative, liberal bias is everwhere.  The liberal media loves to bash Republicans and conservatives with lies and deceit.  Ann  Coulter does and excellent job in pointing out the contast avoidence of facts and truths by one mainstream liberal news anchor, writer, editor, etc. after another.   While I would agree that she does often times spins a vindictive web around the liberal lies and this can sometimes distract from her vaid points, I would also argue that this book isn't for the average reader.  This book challenges the reader to look beyond the lies and look at the ample evidence presented by Ann to demonstrate clearly the liber bias and lies presented to us day in and day out in mainstream media.   If you want an honest look at the modern media bias, this is the book.  She many come of as mean, but then again, considering who she is talking about, can you blame her?
A2Q4NLHQ6ALWXJ	June 28, 2002	5.0	It's hilarious AND it's completely accurate!  Plus I have learned quite a lot of things about, for example, Mr. Al Gore that I *NEVER* would have known if I depended on the New York Times. For example - did you know that during the 2000 election, in front of a crowd of news reporters, Mr. Gore looked straight at a pair of statues depicting George Washington and Ben Franklin and said, "Who are they?"  Neither did I!  Do you think we might have heard about it if George Bush had said it? Buy this book!  You'll LOVE it, I swear!!
A37B3O457INKEA	October 13, 2002	3.0	As its title suggests SLANDER is not really a book about issues. It is instead a long harangue about how the liberals and the media they control attack conservative politicians and their ideas. Naturally a few issues do get mentioned in the process. Coulter is at her best in the concluding chapter where she cites such conservative public policy ideas as Privatizing Social Security, the Strategic Defense Initiative, Pollution Tax Credits, Welfare Reform and the Flat Tax. Throughout the book she also frequently gives credit to Reagan for ending the Cold War. SLANDER may serve a purpose in reminding conservatives that they have a tough opponent in the media. However, the book is very repetitious and Coulter's writing style can get wearisome.
A37BASUCZG1WC9	October 26, 2002	5.0	In "Slander" Ann Coulter shows how the leftist establishment scurrilously maligns conservative America with a barrage that regularly stretches the truth and often utilizes unbridled mendacity. In addition to documenting the vitriol and spurious assaults inflicted by liberal muck-a-mucks (including most of the mass media), the conservative movement's diva returns fire with both barrels. Throughout the cumbersomely annotated work, she displays the acerbic humor that readers of her syndicated column appreciate so well. Along the way she engages in some of the opponents' very same tactics--but provides corroboration for every accusation she propels. No liberal mantra is left standing. On feminism which she says "hasn't made much of a dent in America (but) has taken the worlds of news and entertainment by storm," she compares yesteryear's Hollywood stars like Grace Kelly and Sophia Loren who personified class with today's flash in the pan crowd (Brittanies, Madonnas, Sarah Jessicas etc.) who personify crass. She sarcastically summarizes "whatever feminism is alleged to have accomplished, it did not create a world in which women are admired for something other than playing or being sluts." She addresses the tedious refrain of calling successful Republicans dumb; Ronald Reagan who won the cold war was regularly dismissed as a dunce despite making the world a much safer and more prosperous place to live. Of the current scene, she points out that "George Bush (43) with degrees from Yale and Harvard is ridiculed for his stupidity by Hollywood starlets whose course of study is limited to what they've learned from bald sweaty men on casting couches." To elucidate how disingenuous the left's concept of smarts is, she explains that "liberals idea of intellectual engagement is Bill Clinton 's adolescent cramming in all-night slumber parties leaving the place littered with pizza rinds and women's panties." Regarding the few Republicans who avoid the "D" brand, she discusses the curious exception of Christy Whitman who inaccurately earned the smart label due to her lack of true Republican principles. Skimming over several of the former New Jersey governor's accomplishments (aka goof-ups), the author provides an apt summation: "the woman is a dimwit." She also talks about the unfair distortions in news coverage of liberals vs. conservatives; Bush-speak "subliminable' for example is a lot closer to 'subliminal' than "was the inspiration for 'Love Story' is to 'knew the guy who wrote 'Love Story.'" A Clinton-era shibboleth dictates that exposing personal corruption should be forsaken because it will deter good people from going into politics. Ann Coulter counters that "another possible response to adultery scandals involving politicians is not good people avoiding politics, but politicians avoiding adultery." In a mordant, tables-turning passage she unloads, "the good part about being a Democrat is that you can commit crimes, sell out your base, bomb foreigners, and rape women, and the Democratic faithful will still think you're the greatest. The bad part is that you must effortlessly follow the party orthodoxy, which is completely impenetrable to human logic." No longer can it be said that conservatives can't dish it out as well as liberals! No section is as right on the money or as wickedly risible as the chapter appraising media coverage of that elusive phoenix, "the Religious Right." By meticulously documenting a plethora of chronological articles from liberal-leaning media (primarily "the New York Times" and "the Washington Post") she cites repeated inconsistent references to the mythical "Religious Right" as interchangeably wielding great influence or waning in persuasive heft. No events seem to cause the steep fluctuations in its power, and no supporting criteria are offered to explain the divagations. As to who or what comprises the "Religious Right" none of the sources (nor the author) seem to be able to say. It's a chimerical force that liberals fear but fail to pinpoint exactly why.  It's ironic that one of the book's strong attributes actually becomes a minor drawback. To obliterate any critics, who question the veracity of her arguments, Miss Coulter has painstakingly notated the work. Certain pages are literally laden down with superscript in, alas, what will probably prove a futile undertaking. This phenomenally successful book likely preaches to the choir. It is doubtful that many of the liberal traducers will read a work that so efficaciously deconstructs their strategy.
A38D80PWAXQEUK	March 28, 2003	1.0	If you give a darn about things like this--debunking a blonde "liberal media detective"--you can look up her "facts" quite easily; the library is a good start. My main qualm with this book is that I actually did investigate some of her claims, and found them to be bogus. Fortunately, I borrowed this--OK, I'll be nice--book from my own library and so didn't have to flush any of my hard earned money down the drain. Hope you won't either.
A399L8051ZLQZ9	June 26, 2003	1.0	Please allow me to summarize Ms. Coulter's thesis: all of the problems that we experience in the United States have been caused by liberals so if everyone would just be conservative like me the world would be a happy happy place.  If you are honestly dillusional enough to accept this then by all means buy this book, you two deserve each other.
A3AV17WXN9BXGQ	December 4, 2002	4.0	This book is fine. It offers data to support its conclusion and the data follow a logical sequence. The problem with the book as I see it, is Ann's overall snide, dare I say mean attitude. She is not as nice and joyfull as Rush Limbaugh, and is more brash than Michael Medved. Nor is she as funny as Larry Elder. The book also wont win converts like BIAS might, but none the less if you are a member f the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy, like myself its a worthwhile read.
A3FZOD4YYO2Q3S	October 10, 2002	5.0	If you have an ounce of critical thinking in your body, you owe it to yourself to buy this book, study it, and then use it in defense of common sense--and hence against liberal blather.  She is to conservatism and critical thinking what Rush Limbaugh is to conservatism and humor (with appologies to P. J. O'Rourke and Glenn Beck).  I found myself wishing that she had written this while I was in grad school, so that I could have realized that I was fighting a losing battle by trying to use logic and facts against liberal emotion and name calling.
A3I3AKXS6NVB6U	June 28, 2002	5.0	Ann Coulter, author of High Crimes and Misdemeanors: The Case Against Bill Clinton, has written another hard hitting polemic targeting the left's sacred cows.   Ann has managed to become a lightning rod for Clinton supporters and leftists, and so has first hand experience of the topic she discusses.   The main focus of the book is the inability of the left to debate politics and policy on their merits.  Instead personal attacks, invective and an almost reflexive use of reducto ad absurdem has become the norm.   She peppers the book with witty examples of this.   One need look no further than the 'seminar callers' reviews posted here on Amazon that claim she is inciting militias, advocating the round up of liberals, etc.   The constant refrains from many leftist and socialist writers is  "George Bush is an idiot" not "we disagree with his policies for these reasons".   This represents a breakdown of political discourse.   This extended essay may be a case of preaching to the choir, as most conservatives probably are familiar with the dishonesty and absurd name calling that are the base of too much of the lefts rhetoric these days.  All in all a solid follow up from an author who's previous book arguably effected politics more than any in the last 20 years, as it laid the foundation for the impeachment of Clinton.  Ann shows she was not a "one hit wonder" and offers up an engaging and thought provoking book.
A3JPFWKS83R49V	July 7, 2003	3.0	Ann Coulter is known the world over for her loathing of Democrats and left- leaning individuals. She has written several books relating to this subject and many of them become best- sellers. In this book, Coulter exposes (or attempts to expose) what she feels are some of the key problems with liberals and the liberal way of thinking.  Does Coulter score a knock- out punch? Well, not really. Some of her points are valid and they make sense, while others are not very logical and are often hypocritical. It's true, for example, that liberals, in general, control the media and promote government programs. It's also true that they deliberately attack conservatives whenever the opportunity arises yet they treat liberals with much greater leniency, even when a conservative and a liberal candidate for office have done or spoken exactly the same thing. There is a definite liberal bias in the media, and every one knows it.  Coulter makes other claims, howver, that are a little misguided and she also sticks her own foot in her mouth on several occasions. There's one part in the book where she is talking about the "Religious Right" and trying to rationalize with the reader that this group is not really a threat. Why? because it doesn't have an official headquarters with leaders and other officials! This is a little bit silly, and I'm surprised that Coulter cannot see her own foolishness. Just because there is no official organization doesn't mean that a particular group should be excused from its political undertakings and written off as harmless. It's a known fact that the Religious Right tends to be conservative and its members have taken pride in the fact that they have helped swing elections in favor of conservatives and have helped to push through their own theocratic- laden legislation into several state law books. It makes no difference whether the group has an official organization or not and Coulter knows this. She is only defending them because the members are mostly conservatives.  I don't like the fact that Coulter resorts to so much name calling in this book. It makes her a hypocrite, in my opinion, because she is engaing in exactly the same bevahior that she claims is so wrong with liberals. I also don't like the fact that she claims to be so pro- liberty, yet she supports such government intrusiveness and anti- liberty policies as the war on drugs and other things.  This is the type of book that will get mixed reviews. I recommend reading it only if you're a dyed- in- the- wool Republican or if you have strong conservative leanings. Otherwise, Ann's bashing of liberals in general will really get under your skin.
A3K6CS1D41BN3R	April 11, 2003	5.0	... If you are conservative, you will love this book. It picks apart liberal ideology and backs it up with many anecdotes and referenced facts. I am under no illusion that some of these facts are selectively used to make a point and might in some cases be out of context, but this is one of those situations where you should be outraged if even 10% of the facts are accurate.  The most compelling points deal with the liberalization of the media, which is supported by identifying the backgrounds of many of the well-known TV and newspaper personalities and highlights their liberal upbringing, so to speak. This is contrasted with the conservative representation from the news media and the relative numbers are shocking. The media bias is repeatedly demonstrated by historical phraseology in the published news. The argument against is that these are accepted terms that have found common usage (e.g. moderate conservative). An equally frightening topic is the media's reaction and coverage of the 2000 presidential election. Many of the facts are undeniable, but without having them assembled, the larger picture goes unnoticed. The examples of the media's acceptance of liberal politicians' public mistakes is contrasted to their harsh treatment of conservatives' shortcomings (Quayle's potatoe and Bush's subliminable). The examples she uses are hard to argue with.  Having said all of that, you will probably hate this book if you have strong liberal views. While the author scolds liberals for name-calling, there is a fair amount of that ocurring in the book. I do have to say that the arguments are pretty logical though. If you choose to dismiss them as right-wing rhetoric without applying critical thought, the book will seem tedious. If you are truly trying to expand your perspective of left vs. right bias (regardless of your own position), I think it is a very good read.
A3QA5IQ2DAGTNW	June 27, 2002	5.0	Wow this book is amazing, I picked it up and read it earlier this week and believe me I was shocked to learn about the bias and evils of liberal agenda. How these godless, evil morons control the world's infrastructure and cause such great pain to all the masses in this country and abroad. She picks apart everybody, no one is safe from this crusader of the right-eous cause. Although I think Amazon has it mislisted, isn't this fiction? it's nothing like the real world were I live. Isn't this suppose to be like Wag the dog or Primary Colors? Because if she really believes all of this and there is no mistake uh-oh!
A3R9A2Z9SCC60B	June 30, 2002	5.0	Liberals can't stand it when conservatives adopt their rhetorical style to expose them.  In "Slander", Ann Coulter once and for all speaks for the "silent majority" and challenges us to get mad as hell and not take the liberal mass media lie any longer.  Don't be deceived by liberals disguised as conservatives (Bill O'Reilly) or beguiled by ranters (Limbaugh, Hannity).  Like Laura Ingraham, Coulter is smart, honest, fearless and -- did I mention babe-alicious?  She says what we conservatives (Americans who love America)are thinking.  This and Bernard Goldberg's excellent "Bias" together form the opening salvo in the war against liberal domination of the media.  I hope it sells truckloads, and I hope a media revolution emerges.  If more people had Coulter's sense of frustration and courage to state the facts, we'd all be better off.
A3V59TROUDOLD3	July 9, 2002	5.0	Well-researched and fully-documented, and supremely  witty, Ann Coulter's page-turner book destroys the arguments, misrepresentations, and outright lies of the Left. The title of the book is accurate to a tee. One hates to be unkind to one's sincere enemies, but the enemies that Coulter exposes are generally insincere, irresponsible with facts, and bitter in their methods. They  deserve Coulter's stern rebuke. Despite its "negativism," the book actually celebrates freedom, truth, and goodness.
A3W3CEPSSWRLEN	September 3, 2003	1.0	Just another mouth flapping "conservative" with nothing to back up her views. Is it just me, or did all these neo conservative 'writers' crib their style from P.J. O'Rourke? All they lack is humor.
A913X3CZ55YAA	October 28, 2002	5.0	COULD IT BE BECAUSE ANN IS THE MOST COURAGEOUS, WELL INFORMED, ACCURATE, INDISPUTABLE WRITER CITING DOCUMENTATION PROVING MEDIA LIBERAL BIAS? NA, OF COURSE NOT. THIS BOOK IS PROOF THAT THE LIBERAL MEDIA HAS BEEN DISTORTING AND LYING TO US FOR DECADES. READ IT AND HAVE YOUR BLINDERS RIPPED OFF. SCARY? SURE IT IS. IT'S ALSO HEALTHY. KNOW THE TRUTH. READ IT.
A92DZY1OJ9YQP	July 9, 2002	5.0	Well done, Ann. You must have a photographic memory. Sorting thought the volume of material and putting it together -- wow! I consider myself well informed and yet I was amazed. If you didn't make me laugh so much it would have been a long read. I notice your detractors in these reviews who claim to have read the book all use exactly the non-arguments you show in the book. Not a wisp of logic or fact from them. They didn't really even read it!
A9REHE0UZ54EL	June 30, 2003	5.0	Ignore the whining left. This is a fun book and right on the money. Yesterday I was talking about this book with my one token liberal friend and the Florida vote in the last presidential election came up. My friend claims to live by the rule of Occam's razor, "All other things being equal, the simplest solution is usually the correct one". So I pointed out that maybe the simplest reason Bush won 8 recounts, all of which were done at the request of the democrats and some of which were done by democrats was that Bush actually got more votes. But my liberal friend had a "simpler" solution. All the democrats involved in the recounts had been bought out by the republicans. Liberals really do live in their own fantasy world. If you can read that last sentence and not starting foaming at the mouth you will love this book.
AFBOGQYKKSCZM	June 29, 2002	5.0	Ann does come off a little terse, but this is nothing different then what conservative bashers have been doing for years.  I don't think Ann is going to make any friends out of Liberals with this book, but it is a good read.  One review mentioned that it is Liberals that have made all the great things in this country.  I have to say "Wake Up".  Take everyones money and let the govt decide how to spend it.  Why not let the people who work for their money keep more of it and let them/us decide what to do with it.  The govts. job is not to run our lives and give us what they (govt) think we (the people) need.
AI4UXGII61BEX	July 20, 2003	3.0	After all the hype I just had to read this book.  It does have some good moments - it's worth reading for the humor alone.  However there isn't enough of that, and when Coulter gets on a rant it can go one for pages without really making a point.  She is also a really weak writer and doesn't strike me as being all the bright by the way she writes.  Maybe she is a better speaker but I have never had a chance to find out (I don't watch TV for the very reasons she sites in her book). Overall I would say it's worth your time, just don't get your expectations too high.
ALOYF5UUFEQ61	June 30, 2002	5.0	If a book is a hit if it simultaneously makes you want to cry and laugh out loud, provides fodder for countless hours of fascinating dinner-table conversation, and has the potential to permanently change your world view, then Slander is a hit.  Conservatives will surely find soul-satisfying vindication in this book. But writing Slander off as a Conservative circle-jerk would be a serious mistake. After reading the well-documented and footnoted Slander, there can be little argument about the existence of a "vast left-wing media conspiracy" to silence Conservative dissent while promoting a consistent, well-defined Liberal political agenda. Even if you are a Conservative who is already well familiar with the theories about liberal media bias, you will find new shocking examples of excessive, almost fascist suppression of Conservative discourse.  For example, you might not be aware of the difficulty that Conservative authors have getting books published, or the dramatic variance in advance fees paid by publishers to conservative and liberal authors. Coulter builds a compelling case against liberal media bias, while at the same time lampooning the most irrational and contradictory tenets of liberal philosophy. However, Slander also raises serious issues that can't be dismissed easily. Many of her points will be eye-opening even for those who consider themselves "liberal."  For example, should it be considered "hate speech" when the Leftist reporters unceasingly describe the "religious right" as "evil" "authoritarian" "Nazis"? Or when major U.S. news services even-handedly group Islamic militants with retired Midwestern Americans as "rightwing religious conservatives"?  Truthfully, what's the difference between marginalizing and demonizing Christians in 21st century America from marginalizing and demonizing Jews in 20th century Germany? Take your favorite liberal rant against religion and substitute the word "Jews" for "Christian Conservatives". Remind you of anyone?  Scary, isn't it? Coulter paints the picture and lets the reader draw his or her own conclusions without preaching. This is only one example of the many larger social issues that Coulter identifies in Slander. In spite of the serious, almost frightening nature of the issues raised by the book, Coulter consistently maintains a wry and bombastic sense of humor that offsets the sobering recognition that the situation is much worse than most of us have realized. In Slander, Coulter organizes, identifies and documents broad themes of liberal media abuse. For example, she groups examples of liberal media "spin" into such categories as:  -
AMQ37QNEIZCGS	March 7, 2003	3.0	An amusing book, but hardly worth the time & expense. This stuff IS the media mainstream now, the political equivalent of so-called "reality" shows.   Classic liberalism died along with Hubert Humphrey's defeat in 1968, so conservatives have been forced for years to create a paper enemy out of a mildly left centrism in order to have something to fight.  Liberalism now is merely tolerance slanted toward certain favored "identity" movements, an easy target indeed. Lightweight liberalism begets this sort of "right lite" commentary.  Coulter can say anything she wants with impunity, because there's no Paul O'Dwyer types around anymore to kick her ... for it.
AP3V63JVKLEO5	July 6, 2002	5.0	As a retired psychotherapist I had to read "Slander" myself because it was obviously hitting a nerve in some reviewers. I discovered that there is no in-between on Ann Coulter's book; you will either love it or hate it. I loved its crystal-clear, well-documentated examples of pervasive liberal fuzzy thinking. It hits liberals in their weak spot by revealing their flawed logic and utter lack of objectivity. Coulter illustrates with hilarious wit how liberals consider intellectualism to be their private domain, and how they squeal loudly when their intelligence is attacked with documented examples. Their only defense in such instances is to mount personal attacks on the author, in this case, Ann Coulter, and start name-calling.  I have enjoyed the one and two star reviews on "Slander" almost as much as I enjoyed the book itself. I expect the percentage ratio of "help" versus "no-help" responses to this review to further reflect the liberal bias of some of the readers.  What fun to twist their tails..!!  BUY AND READ THIS BOOK...!! Al Thompson, Brady, Texas
AUFLMF9XUZZH	October 23, 2002	4.0	Ann Coulter's strength as a writer lies not only in her blitzkrieg-ish sense of humor, but also in her intelligence and understanding of the nature of politics.  Subtlety is not her modus operandi, so anyone searching for a drawing room discourse on the current American political scene should steer clear of this book. "Slander" is Coulter's fusion of facts and entertainment, and she mixes them well.  One can actually sift the humor from the book and be left with a respectable body of well-documented information.  Her wit is often scathing, so to those with tender sensibilities: beware. Coulter criticizes the American media for liberal bias, and so many people have raised a cry of "hypocrisy!" at Coulter's display of her biases in this book.  This criticism is a non-issue, as books provide a perfectly respectable forum for presenting one's opinions, while the nature of journalism stresses reliance on facts, not feelings.  Coulter provides plenty of both, and that is what gives this book substance. What Coulter implies in her book is that liberalism is a cancer that, if it goes unchecked, will eat away at America from the inside out.  Liberalism weakens America; it feeds on the poor, the gullible, and those who seek personal (and unearned) gain based on race or social standing.  It promotes the "what's in it for me?" mentality; it rewards mediocrity, at the expense of those who achieve; it seeks to model the world on that of an ant colony, while ignoring the vital difference between humans and ants: a reasoning mind capable of independent thought.  "Slander" directly attacks the liberal mentality, not with a finely honed blade, but with all the finesse of a pickaxe.  Whatever tools Coulter uses to drive home her message, it's clear that they are wielded by a master.
A178VWQH7MMOBG	July 7, 2002	5.0	Whether you love her or hate her, Ann Coulter is one of the brightest and most articulate pundits out there.  Her book takes an Honest look at the Hipocracy in the left and instead of partisan name-calling delivers fact after fact of lies perpertrated by the left, each instance is footnoted and can be referenced in the back of the book.   Bottom Line:  Do yourself a favor, take off your blinders and read this book!  You'll come away enlightened and most likely a few I.Q. points ahead of where you started.
A19ABW3S9KCDOR	April 21, 2003	1.0	As a Brit who regularly votes Tory (that's the British version of the Republican party for those of you who aren't aware of the fact - Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher and the like) I am nevertheless astonished at the extent to which American politics seems to have become personalised and... well... shrill, recently. We have a saying in Britain that what happens in America will happen in Britain two years down the road - well here's hoping we pass on this sort of thing! This is a TERRIBLE book. It's been a personal object lesson in why you shouldn't allow morbid curiosity to get you to fork out good money. The literary/political equivalent of slowing down on the road to stare at the results of a car crash. Mean spirited, partisan nonsense. And most (not all) of it IS nonsense. Since this book I've seen Ann Coulter on a political panel show (where she talked over and shouted down the host and all the other panelists, including the historian Niall Ferguson who was meant to be there to back up her side of the argument) and tracked down some of her articles and... oh dear.  Seriously folks, if you want to seem like a well-informed, non-clinically insane conservative, go and read Edmund Burke. Or Thomas Hobbes. Or even P. J. O'Rourke or Mark Steyn. Or anything but this. This is shockingly bad, mean spirited nonsense that preaches to the converted and tells a certain sort of person what they want to hear and not much else.  Before people start claiming I'm some sort of left wing plant (though I suppose given that I don't subscribe to the idea that there's some sort of [plan] sweeping the western world I will be considered inherently suspect) I should point out that this sort of thing is not a sin that is exclusive to the right. The left has more than it's share of cranks too. But don't be fooled into thinking that this book is anything other than a right wing version of the sort of [weak information] by the likes of Al Sharpton and Noam Chomsky because it isn't.  Also, for the record while we're on the subject, Bill Clinton - neither the [bad guy] nor the great white liberal hope. Just a profoundly forgettable, superficially attractive (to some - I never understood personally) mediocrity. There, I've said it. Startling revelation isn't it?
A1ILBKPRXHOO8P	July 10, 2002	3.0	If Coulter's goal was to rile up controversy, puff up the faithful with self-righteousness and make her opponents angry, she succeeded brilliantly. If Coulter's goal was to entertain and put together a fast, enjoyable read, she succeeded again.  If she just wanted to make a lot of money, again she hit the mark. Coulter's goal wasn't, however, to add anything useful to public debate.  That's fine - there are writers on the left, such a Michael Moore, that are Coulter's equivalent.  If you mistake either Moore or Coulter for a person providing genuine analysis or debate, you really need to read more. Both Coulter and Moore have the same world view: there is an "enemy," be they the "liberals" or the "conservatives," that embodies a relatively monolitic and purely evil philosophy, which manipulates the incredibly gullible citizens of this great country with pathetically illogical arguments and outright lies.  These people are dangerous, and Moore and Coulter are sounding the alarm.  There is nothing good, pure, or sensible in the so-called ideas of the enemy, and the opinions of the faithful are the purest common sense. The reality, of course, is that 75% of the population is somewhere in the middle, and "left" and "right" are simply labels used to demonize those on the other side of an issue. Politicians don't follow a philosophy, or they are tossed out - their main job is to bring home the bacon for their states or districts, and dress up the rationale in the empty catchphrases of the party platform.   This isn't a bad thing: it is the way a representative democracy works. Having watched Bill Clinton sign welfare reform and Ted Kennedy campaign with George Bush on education reform (although the alliance was short-lived) gives most people a clue that the world is not black and white.  Once someone (like Moore or Coulter) announces that he or she is going to advance a vision of politics that makes Star Wars seem morally complex, they forfeit any claim to be considered as anything more than entertainers.  The fact that these sorts of authors throw in footnotes to support their overblown claims doesn't exactly make them scholars. If you want to learn about policy, read a book that covers a limited number of topics in detail, by someone with the credentials to explain it with authority.  For example, if you are looking for conservative social commentary, try Alan Bloom or Richard Posner.  If you want to escape into a fantasy of pure good versus pure evil, watch a John Wayne movie.  If you want to be entertained by the excessive rantings of people like Moore and Coulter, go for it.  But you'll only embarrass yourself if you take them seriously.
A1J0YNR1SSFCVS	January 10, 2003	4.0	Coulter is outspoken, but she demonstrates the point that the media is dominated by the left-wing. The name calling and snippy comments are annoying, but easy to skip over, and some are quite amusing, such as the well-publicized "Eva Braun of morning TV". I can understand that she needs to be outspoken, to stand out from the other conservative books. This book does compare reasonably well with most of the conservative books that I have read, but will never match Rush or Buckley in style or passion. Coulter's analysis of the 2000 presidential elections, especially with the times for calling the various races, is well done and worth the price of the book by itself. The sections on the success of conservative books and talk shows also provides information that I have not seen elsewhere. She is obviously bright, and the book is well-researched, but it does not really tell a story well. Her style is a recitation of very interesting facts, and then BOOM the book is over. I would like to see Coulter take on Al Franken in a televised debate. How would ... react to a micro-skirt? Do yourself a favor and get the book instead of the audiotape with its annoying Valley Girl reader.
A1Q8RKN3R8UVQT	June 27, 2002	5.0	Good political invective is rare. Ann Coulter has written a book that is full of the good stuff. She gets a little repetitious in the end, but the attacks just never stop. She even makes some good points along the way. If you are looking for a balanced appraisal of media bias, give this book the miss. If you like firm opinions well-stated (even when you disagree with them), then this will be a rewarding read. Miss Coulter is not trying to win over the left's hearts and minds, she is rallying the troops on the right. I expect the points she raises here to be brought up again by other rightists throughout the coming election year.
A1S8DVYJDNR93W	January 15, 2003	4.0	Ann Coulter's Slander is definitely an interesting read. But if you are prone to being upset by the open hostility that American conservatives suffer at the hands of liberal Democrats everyday, reading this book will really make your blood pressure soar. Be prepared! With more than 700 footnotes throughout the 9 chapters and conclusion of this book, Ms. Coulter's exhaustive research leaves little room for liberals to "cry foul." Indeed, you're left wondering how in the world we, as Americans, have allowed the liberal left's monopoly of mainstream national media to continue. I believe any rational person, regardless of his or her political views, should be angered at the obvious manipulation we have all suffered at the hands of the media. Manipulation that will become even more obvious to you after reading this book. I really enjoyed the fact that this book was not "dumbed down" to such a low reading level that you feel as if you're being spoon-fed the information. But on the other hand, Ms. Coulter's style of writing is not over the heads of those, like myself, who have no political experience and who are just recently starting to delve into the realm of political reading. The only issue I had with this book at all was that Ms. Coulter had a tendency to simply mention a person's name or a former newsworthy event without really explaning any details about that person or event. Therefore, if you're like me and you never really cared about or paid attention to politics before, some of the points she makes may require further research on your own. But if you've kept up with mainstream politics for the last 20 or so years, you will be able to read this book quickly and smoothly, without interruption to go on the Internet and find out who in the world she is talking about.
A1XH5FT96CV1NE	July 17, 2002	4.0	Slander is one of those books you cannot put down after you've read the first several pages.  It's a must-read if you're conservative.  Equally so if you're liberal.   Ann Coulter is a new breed of conservative commentator.  In this no-holds-barred book, Miss Coulter documents the inconsistencies, ommissions and not so subtle tactics of the liberal establishment. Indeed, this well footnoted book leaves few questions where Coulter gathered her information.  The footnotes are as much fun to read as the book itself. Some of the book is eye-opening.  Some of it plain weird.  From the New York Times fawning over authors that carry on the liberal agenda to Rober Ebert dabbling in politcal commentary (note to Roger:  stick to film reviews), there is plenty to digest and think about. Ever wonder why some republicans are introduced (on TV, radio, etc) as conservative, but you'll never hear a democrat introduced as liberal (or rarely anyway)?  This book will help you understand. I wonder what the liberal response will be?  If I've learned anything from this book, it will probably be a personal attack on Ann Coulter.  Not to worry....she can take care of herself. Ann.....great job!
A20ZD6VBJFBIZQ	July 10, 2003	5.0	Whether one agrees with Ms. Coulter's political idealogy or not one has to admire her intelect and her ability to cut through nonsense and get to the haeart of what really matters. She is, and this is no exageration, one of the sharpest writers I have ever read. I have heard her talk but it was not until I started reading her book that I realized how unique a gift she had. Like all great writers she forces you to think about certain issues in a different light and from different angles.  All I can say is that I have nothing but admiration for her abilities.
A20ZDV9ZEESN5K	October 17, 2003	1.0	Worse than a female Rush Limbaugh, more vicious than a cornered rat,  not powerful at all,  Ms. Coulter seems to be little more  than a bandwagon jumper who will find shortly that the bandwagon now is horseless.   The premise of the book got my attention and got me to read it. However, lest there be any confusion,  the title of the book is not reflective of the contents which are little more than the collective ramblings of a pre-modern maniac depressive.   There is some clarity to her thought process in stark contrast to the drug induced largely  incoherent ramblings of Mt. Limbaugh.  Bottom line - read the book if you want to try to comprehend the otherise incomprehenisble but try to borrow it so Ms. Coulter is not financially rewarded for her bigotry.
A2HBSAF83AUMXW	January 13, 2003	1.0	Please! 'Liberal Bias' in the media? Who owns the media? Ralph Nader? Michael Moore? NO! G.E. etc. etc. infinitum.  Only a moron could buy this bill of goods. Listen to CNN or FOX, or Rush or Hanratty etc. How many 'liberal' commentators do you find to counterbalance these frothing right-wingers who distort the truth freely and practice demagoguery a black art.  Only a fool could believe that a media that is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few large multinational corporations could have a 'liberal agenda'.  Only a fool could fail to see that Whitewater garnered millions of words more coverage than the S&L crises or the Enron debacle - both of which wiped out milions of pensioners. (and Bush family involved in both). See the movie 'Bob Roberts' and learn something about how you are manipulated. Wake up and stop being spoon-fed this tripe. It simply fails under the slightest critical scrutiny.
A2LF1ICX4KVI78	June 27, 2002	5.0	The book's popularity and the Amazon's reviews (6 so far)seem to be at polar opposites. Could it be that Ms. Coulter's reports have struck a nerve and folks want to read about it? I think so! Ms. Coulter's commentary is quite partisan but most readers know this already. I suspect that many conservatives will purchase this to have more examples of the ever apparent liberal bias that exists in the media today, Fox News notwithstanding. The reader will have many examples of liberal lies of the American Right. I look forward to the second edition!
A2RY1LTSW3HZY4	July 5, 2002	2.0	This is a typical book of its sort...in other words, if you're a conservative reading it, you'll love it.  If you're a liberal reading it, you'll hate it.  Ms. Coulter decides to eschew any sort of reasonable even-handedness, and resorts to right-wing demagoguery throughout the book.  It reads like a slightly less dopey version of Rush Limbaugh, and makes you wonder if anyone is interested in examining both sides of an issue anymore.  Oh, wait, the liberal side is argued EVERYWHERE ELSE, so we need books like these.  Sorry.  Forgot.
A2TWHSBVVBC9JX	June 28, 2002	5.0	This book covers, in the authors unique-take no prisoners style, the ongoing bias that the major media has against any person or organization right of center. Many comparisons will be made to Bernard Goldberg's "Bias", but while Mr. Goldberg thinks that the anti-right bias in the media is accidental, perhaps unintetional, Coulter demonstrates an intense desire by the major media to demonize the political right, and use the bully pulpit of television and newspapers to do it. If you have seen Ms. Coulter on one of her television appearances, you know that she is extremely intelligent, and has a quick, cutting wit. She also has a very good writing style that makes the book a joy to read. Reading the book reveals the passion she feels for the subject, but unlike many writers on the left, she also backs it up with intellectual thought. Ignore the 1-star reviews from the knee-jerk leftist reviewers and read this book. If you're on the right side of the political spectrum, this book will summarize all of those things you suspected about the major media. If you're on the left, this book may infuriate you... but if you're an intellectually honest leftist, it will demonstrate a truth you may not have noticed in the past. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
A2VIBK8OLX04DX	December 29, 2002	1.0	Yes, I'm a liberal. Yes, Ann Coulter drives me crazy. And yes, I actually read this book (I took it out from the library...I would not pay for it) to see where the other side is coming from. I have watched Ann Coulter on TV for years, and I as much as I disagree with her politics and her tactics, I did expect the book to be somewhat intelligent.  After reading it, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that Ann Coulter isn't much of a foe after all--she's just an angry name-caller. I haven't a clue as to what has brought Ann to be so angry...in fact, much of what she slings is dispassionate and seems pretty fake... . Then again, can you blame me? Ms. Coulter's writing isn't designed to find common ground and promote understanding between left and right...she's inspired me to sling a few insults back in her corner.  But she also inspired me in a way she may not have intended...and in that way, Ann Coulter may be a closet liberal operative. Too many liberals have become jaded and cynical and dormant in these past years...with more attacks lobbed their way, instead of remaining silent, they may reawaken and get more involved in politics. There ARE more of us out there, despite what election results tell us.  Ann has inspired me to get active, and ultimately, and for that reason alone, I'm happy I read this otherwise empty and polarizing book.
A33WROIMGXTYMW	February 13, 2003	5.0	This book should be a must-read for conservatives. Coulter convincingly demonstrates and documents (with thirty plus pages of endnotes) the way the liberal Left caricatures the right as mean, uncaring, stupid and intolerant. The mainstream media response to the book simply served to confirm Coulter's basic premise. Of the five or so interviews with Coulter I saw on the cable news networks only TWO interviewers attempted to take the book seriously, Judith Reagan and Sean Hannity, both on Fox. The other interviewers attempted to pin Coulter into a corner arguing with her over trivial details in the book having no direct correlation to the book's premise. No one on the Left could make cogent, intellectual counter-arguments so they just nit-picked the book to death or went after Ann personally. Unfortunate as this was for an author trying to discuss her work intelligently and have it taken seriously, nevertheless it also made for great PR as it demonstrated exactly the point Coulter makes in the book. I think what bothers the Left is that Coulter is able to use reason, logic and sound scholarship to make her point. This is something the Left doesn't seem to know how to do. The Left can't or won't defend its position in an intelligent, reasoned fashion. It is therefore left with name-calling, character assasination and avoidance of the issue. Which Coulter masterfully chronicles in the book. As demonstrated in the interviews with Coulter, in its response to this book, the Left indicted itself.
A3ANUYN0YN55Y2	November 8, 2002	1.0	I'm about as politically conservative as a person can get without belonging to the "Religious Right."  Yet, I found this book painful to read.  And while Ann is right on track with much of her political philosophy, the method of her argument takes away her credibility.  For example, the first chapter or so focuses primarily on how in place of legitimate debate, liberals resort to labeling and name-calling conservatives.  True.  However, in the very next breath so resorts to calling liberals names!!!  That makes her a hypocrite.   Ann Coulter is to conservative Republicans what Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton are to liberal Democrats: people who, because of their over-zealous attempt to prove their point, sacrifice their credibility and undercut the very cause they are promoting in the first place.  This book is merely a sensationalizing rant, much like her diatribes as the representative of the "conservative" position on national TV talk shows.  And I guess when you rant in around 200 pages of print, the organization of your written argument also suffers, or at least it does for Ann.  I wish I had known that before I added this book to my shopping cart here on...
A3F42CJXDOE8O1	July 26, 2003	1.0	Ah Yes another year and another work of fiction from Conservative lunatic Ann Coulter. In her latest book she tells even more lies then in her last, believe it or not. Among her many laughable assertions are that: 1. JFK was a Traitor, even though he was a war hero who fought for his country and brought us back from the brink of nucleur war. 2. Harry Truman was a traitor evn though he defeated the japanese to win the war for America. 3. Joe McCarthy was a great man, even though he was a psychopath who saw communists under his bed, and ruined hundreds of innocent lives. And finally, that Democrats can't win wars, even though we won WWII and Kosovo. Ann Coulter may have a nice booty, but other then that she is a waste of space. In medieval times Ann Coulter would have been known as a "Wandering Idiot", a person who travels the countryside babbling nonsense. The difference is that at least back then, they knew enough not to give "Wandering idiots" Book deals
A3GCC0XOURL9U4	February 7, 2004	4.0	It's nice to see some one stand up and say what most americans think. I like the fact that she is not "political" in her criticism.  She calls it liks she see it.
A3HG8AOP4ZRYGR	July 14, 2002	5.0	Ms Coulter has done an outstanding research job and tells it like it really is.  It took me a little longer to read this book than the usual book simple because I would get so disgusted at the liberals and media who are so vicious in their attacks. I see this every single day when I open a newspaper or turn on network news. It should make every American mad and sick at heart to be subjected to the liberal airheads to have nothing to offer but character assignation or empty self serving agendas. THANK YOU ANN COULTER.  Please keep up the good work and I hope your book encourages others to follow your lead. ...
A3M0YP958H2KRX	July 15, 2002	5.0	Ann Coulter writes with a combination right hook and left uppercut.  SLANDER is one of those books that will either delight you or infuriate you, but it will not bore you.  Her indictment of the mainstream media is strident and scathing, yet she punctuates her ides with evidence and anecdotes which strongly support her position. The author is a frequent guest on the many political talk shows and generally holds her own against her counterparts in the mainstream (read "liberal") media.  In addition, her columns, appearing in a number of conservative venues (from which much of this book is gleaned), are well written.  She is outspoken, often irritating (even to conservatives), yet wholly engaging and entertaining while offering opinions of well-reasoned substance as well. Her main theme (that everything that is wrong with America is due to the liberals) may be somewhat over the top, however Ann makes a compelling case for the need to reverse the overwhelming liberal bias in the media and society which often overwhelms fact with a patina of political correctness.
A3NXCSLC50SCG3	July 12, 2002	5.0	This is THE best book ever written on the subject of media bias, all the liberals can attack (Angstone, Dan Barr, Joe, lady lark etc.) but not one of them can dispute the FACTS. Read the footnotes and then make your arguments (if you can) instead of attacking you should try to learn. You have had the media pouring out distortions for years and still the TRUTH WINS OUT. Get your heads out of the sand of denial and give Ann Coulter a GREAT AMERICAN credit for exposing this liberal slant on the truth.
A3NXCSLC50SCG3	July 7, 2002	5.0	SLANDER is a great book documented with fact after fact, liberals just cannot except the truth. They are so used to the biased media slanting news to the liberal view that they vomit all over themselves when the other side is heard. Sean, Antonio(the real airhead) and Kathleen quickly go on the attack, because Ann Coulter hits the mark time after time. Liberals can't even be honest with themselves, just check out the footnotes in the book and there is no argument that Ann is once and for all exposing what's happening to this country. Debate not lies is the answer.
A3VU1IK7M2HNMD	September 12, 2003	1.0	This book is full of blame game and hate. She is in denial about most of the facts. The book is very predictable and every fact is twisted with an right winged agenda.  Spare yourself from this hate filled book and a few bucks.
A6FIAB28IS79	July 3, 2002	1.0	...If this book is "timely" despite its sniping and anachronisms, it's only because of a curious new nationalism that confuses flag waving, party bashing, and finger pointing with patriotism. And while many of us may be genuinely disturbed about where the country, international affairs, the environment and the economy are headed next, books like Coulter's at least offer some form of cathartic diversion to the many reductivists out there.
AANL91KHH6QRO	June 27, 2002	5.0	Just like Rush's books, and like the book 'Bias' the liberals come out of the woodwork and 'slander' the authors' personas saying nobody shares these 'right wing' ideas and nobody is reading nor should anybody read these books.  How did they end up on the best seller lists?  I recommend people ignore the bias and actually read the books to form their own opinions.  What a unique concept.
ADYNO5CD0GVFE	October 9, 2003	5.0	A good political analyst will be enjoyed by all.  A truly great political analyst will be loved by some and hated by others.  Ann Coulter has provided us a well doumented thesis of political analysis.  She does what the great analysts will do, she uses actual statements and actual events to support her thesis of the nauseating attempts being made to sway the public mind.  I stayed away from this book for as long as I did due to the hyperbole Coulter garners from those who hate her.  I hate to say it, but I allowed the hateful comments of idiots like al franken to color my view of Coulter to the degree that I thought she was too extreme.  That is, until I began reading comments like: "Columnist Molly Ivins has a coffee cup that 'bravely' proclaims, 'Well Behaved Women Rarely make History' and a book of her columns was titled 'Molly Ivins Can't Say That Can She?'  What precisely," Ann asks, "does Ivins say that everyone else is not saying?"  I believe this could be called the thesis statement of her book.  They're all saying the same things, they're all attacking the same boogey men, and often they're even using the same words to do so.  "The Republican president is dumb." She documents how unfortunate it is that such a childish statement when repeated often enough will cause people to start to believe it.  She proclaims that every Republican president, and candidate, since Eisenhower, has been called dumb.  Every democrat, on the other hand, is well-traveled and well-read.  She documents Bob Packwood's rise to liberal, Republican power through press clippings only to lead to an historical fall when the media no longer needed him.  She states that there is a myth called the "religious right" that is so mythical in stature that both parties, both sides of the religious spectrum, and all of those engaged in political analysis can attack the "religious right" without fear of recourse.  I didn't want to take up too much of your time with this review, but I thought you should be given the chance to see through the hyperbole and judge some of the content yourself.  Agree with her or not, Coulter has slammed her foot into the synthetic turf the media has created for us, and she has demanded to be taken seriously.  Me thinks that none of us will be able to ignore her for YEARS to come.  I hope those of you with a curious mind will enjoy this as I have.
AHYOZKFT91RPR	June 28, 2002	5.0	Once again, Ann Coulter has written an excellent book showing what is wrong with the mindset of the Liberals, who are not only attacking her (as witnessed by the other reviews in this section written by people who haven't even seen the book), but attacking this country as well. Liberal lies about conservatives did not start with the outcry over cutbacks to the school lunch program, and they will not end until they acknowledge their moral inferiority.
AOMKBHCE2D8NQ	June 29, 2003	5.0	Just finished this book. Wow. Ann hits it dead on. This should be required reading for all thinking Americans. This has to scare liberals to death. Watch them get out their flame-thowers and attempt to discount Ann's truths.
AOV9AIX4UE5BB	June 27, 2002	5.0	This is the #1 selling book at Amazon today.  I guess not *everyone* agrees with the other reviewers.  Actually, I think this book is what America is all about:  our right to free speech.  I enjoyed reading it, and even though I don't necessarily agree with all her points, I respect her right to air them.  She most definitely has a way with words.  Life would be dull, indeed, if we all had the exact same philosophy.
AUHG8KSHI529U	July 18, 2002	5.0	From what I saw on TV and heard on radio and read in the press, I expected a cover to cover screed with ad hominem attacks followed by more ad hominem attacks.  When I actaully READ the book it turned out to be something quite different. What you get is a look at media claims about the objectivity and centrism compared with what they actually say and do.  There are 35 (thirty-five) pages of small-type footnotes documenting these stories so you can check for yourself if the author has presented the story or comment accurately.  While I can't claim to have made a comprehensive check, what I have looked at has either been dead on or - at worst - maybe a bit ambiguous (and not many of those, however).  This is a better track-record than I have seen from FAIR's attacks on the conservatives. Ann Coulter is not objective, and does not claim to be.  She is a conservative partisan and given to hyperbole.  This is hurt her a couple of times, but it certainly makes her prose vivid.  She is also very tough and not willing to make nice-nice with those who want to undermine her credibility via ad-hominem venom masquerading as analysis.  And since she is a woman, being that tought is hard for some to accept. At our house, however, she is accepted.  We understand her frustration in not seeing her viewpoint given a serious presentation in the mainstream discussion of issues (except on the periphery and always with "distancing quotes" and verbal cues to alert the viewer to be on guard for what is to follow.  I live in Ann Arbor and grew up in Wayne County.  Being a conservative has not been easy around here.  Don't get me wrong, I haven't been trashed or threatened, but there have been many times when I have taken a lonely stance and have had to resist great social pressure to conform. This media bias (witting or unwitting) is also discussed in Bernard Goldberg's wonderful "Bias", but this book is less restrained in its tone and, yes, "Slander" does have an acerbic edge.  But being acerbic or sardonic is NOT the same as ad hominm or mean or false. Another wonderful book to read if you are interested in understanding the problem of liberal bias is Thomas Sowell's "The Vision of the Anointed".  But that book was also reviewed through ad hominem rather than debated. That this book has zoomed to the top of the best seller list speaks to the vast unreported frustration of citizens with the media.  Well, maybe unreported is a bit strong.  It is reported, but usually as the frustration of the ignorant, unsophisticated, and uninformed.  That kind of reporting only adds to the frustration because we aren't any more ignorant, unsophisticaed, or uninformed than those espousing the liberal viewpoint. This book should be read if for nothing else than its footnotes.  If you hate Coulter, fine.  Don't read the book itself. Just read the footnotes, and go look up the sources, and then spend some time reflecting on what those articles and statements really mean. Is it really possible that there is NO point here?  That is for each reader to decide.  But I bet that the great majority of the readers of this book will decide that this book makes a big point that is important for our current media discourse.
AWWY3C8REGJK3	August 24, 2003	5.0	Too many people view Ann Coulter through their in-place political lens. As a consequence many who disagree spent all of their energy venting spleen and ignoring the splendid logic and thorough scholarship that went into this Coulter gem as it has with all of her's. If the reader is willing to accept the fact that the world as we see it may not be exactly the world we think it to be, then Ann Counter can be a valuable learning experience. If, on the other hand, the reader is comfortable with preconception and does not wish to leave a comfort zone they you might wish to give this a pass. One reason that Ann Counter elicits the depth of response that she is able to evoke is precisely because she takes on the most solidly entrenched beliefs that she thinks are false and exposes them. Some people do not wish to see the emperor naked and will avert their eyes. Others will recognize the truth and profit thereby. Coulter brings exceedingly sharp wit, a great sense of humor and biting commentary to the subject of media bias, exposing it along the way for the propaganda machine that it has become. She thinks out of the box with a sense of history and a strong moral core that characterizes her as a person and as a writer. Growth is painful for some, happier for others. Slander was a happy experience for me and I hope will be for you too.
AXJXB89NPQA6E	November 8, 2002	5.0	Ann Coulter takes no prisoners, and this book is evidence of that. At times hilariously funny, and eminently readable, this book is a fascinating piece if journalism.  As an attorney, she knows the value of a footnote, and there are pages and pages of them.  Her lightning-fast and knife-edge sharp arguments are incredibly well thought out, and even when you don't agree with her you have to admit she's made a good argument. Don't miss this one if you have any interest in politics or society today.
AY93QYXXG6IFJ	September 1, 2003	1.0	This lady is very disturbed, i.e. sick.  You see her o TV, read her stuff in the print media, and I suppose she is even on radio spreading her trash.  This book is a waste of your time.  Check it out from your library and read as much of it as you can stomach.  Very disturbing - but,this garbage sells.
AYJXX2BZNXFAC	April 17, 2003	1.0	What a depressing book. How is it that those people who constantly complain about the coarsening of our society and the harsh partisanship of our politics, turn a harpy like this into their goodess?

A12W3REPATK57X	June 27, 2002	5.0	"Slander" is a no holds barred work of tremendous wit and intelligence. Although there are points which I wish were more thoroughly supported, the book in total was an excellent dissection of the omnipresent skewing of facts by the elite media. Conservatives will enjoy this, knee jerk liberals probably won't.
A12W3REPATK57X	June 27, 2002	4.0	Although not always as precise in her criticims of the liberal elite as I would prefer, her examples of bias are so great in number, one cannot go about reading this book without honestly acknowledging Ms. Coulter has something here. She is without a doubt one of the wittiest conservative writers today. Her style, which I finding engaing, is no holds barred. For a conservative this is a great read, for a liberal a must read.
A15A23MDS3SEY2	September 7, 2003	4.0	Finally the conservative movement has a female voice who shouts out just as loudly and harshly as every liberal who runs the media.  Coulter is right in her arguments which is the scary part.  She talks of how the liberal media terribly pander to the left while ignoring or demeaning the right at all costs.  From every other review on this site you would think that she made it all up but many of her points are things liberals have even admitted but have decided to bury.      Coulter talks of how liberals basically trash talk Bush for being stupid, okay now if you watch the news or read a paper or do anything pertaining to the media you know this is something liberals do daily.  All Coulter then says is how can liberals say this when Bush went to Yale and Harvard and graduated from both.  Coulter is just pointing out the truth and shining some light onto what liberals have kept hidden.  According to liberals the Clinton administration was the best administration in the White House ever.  Coulter just writes they aren't and then puts in passages from Liberal newspapers (papers that show Gore not knowing who George Washington was and Clinton not knowing anything about the US Military) that prove her point.  So how is she crazy?      Coulters book is full of facts, truths, and though she may write it in a harsh way so what.  Do we think liberals are nice when there books are entitles "Lies and the Lying Liars who tell them".  Please, Coulter is just giving it back as good as liberals do but she does it with honesty.  Everyone, no matter conservative or liberal should read this book to see the truth, to see another side of the issues in today's society.     Slander is a good book.  It is full of truths about how the media always fails to be as balanced as we would like them to be.  Read this book and don't listen to the Lying Liars who wrote every single other review for Slander on this site.
A1LE6BAXHZEPH8	July 1, 2002	5.0	Well documented expose of the damage the liberal "progressives" do to US policies. To the point and at times laugh-out-loud funny, this book is to be feared by every elitist, limousine liberal, hypocritical leftist. It's entertaining, well written books such as this that will, one can hope, finally bring to account the liberals and the sycophant media pushing the liberal agenda!
A1T4UP5DY9YZKH	July 3, 2002	1.0	In broad terms isn't the political spectrum: socialist-liberal-conservative?  In other words, by definition, liberal is middle-of-the-road.  So assuming Ann is right (about as far right as you can get I'd say) then all she's achieved in her book is to show the media taking the middle ground.  Which makes it the absolute definition of unbiased.   So she's complaining, even on her own analysis, not that the media is biased but that it is not biased towards the right ( which to me it clearly is). So this is what she really means; if you're not right wing then you're anti-USA, anti-government, anti-establishment, etc, etc. No middle ground, no opportunity to be the kind of person who analyses the facts and arrives at a conclusion - you either toe the Republican party line or you're a Communist.  At times she's nothing short of hysterical (not in the humorous sense) - on her analysis Attila the Hun would be a liberal. This book has its moments of humour, but is ultimately like her personal appearances - filled with ranting innacuracies and a sense that she's out of control.  A biased media of the kind Ann imagines would talk about poverty, government corruption, corporate corruption, futility of war, workers rights, social confidtions, racism, etc etc.  On the rare occassions when it mentions any of these it does so only in the context of the middle class and above that it represents.
A1TXT26XO55BKK	December 14, 2002	5.0	As you can see by the comments above, Ann's book "Slander" has upset the commie/libs.  If Slander had nothing to offer the reader, the wacko leftwing would never have found it to be a threat, yet the vile spewing crowd has arrived to write nasty commentaries about this great book. Ann is a very serious Conservative...The kind we need many more of.  If you can handle the truth, read "Slander".  If you voted for Comrade Billy Clinton, call your cardiologist prior before you read Ann's lastest expose' on the radical, God-hating left wing in America...
A1VO465R7AGU5U	July 7, 2002	5.0	The DNC seminar reviewers are out in full force writing childish rants that do not present any logical evidence that Ms. Coulter is off the mark.  Anyone who values truth cannot ignore her points, which are well-researched and often recalled by those of us who have been aware of liberal bias in the media for years.  The grown-ups of today recognize her truths each time we subject ourselves to the mainstream media.  How thankful I am that her voice is being heard and is ticking off the name-calling negative reviewers.  Thanks, liberal reviewers, for offering immediate support of her premise with your rants and raves (and insults to Ann Coulter's looks).  You prove her point!
A23BJGYEF4B2LQ	January 16, 2003	1.0	Never has a title more accurately described the contents of a book.  Coulter is one of those hysterical demagogues who give those of us in the center (hint: we're the ones you have to convince if you want to win elections) a reason to vote for Democrats. The New York Times is no more liberal than the New York Post is conservative. Somehow, though, nobody outside New York is too interested in anything the Post has to say. If Republicans want their media to be taken seriously, they will have to do better than Coulter.
A27PVWX8TEP7AN	June 30, 2002	5.0	I loved her book, because I know what she is saying is true.  She gives plenty of research and facts in her book to support her statements (A big part of the appendix is reference sources), unlike the liberals who attack with name calling and lies and never a logical argument( if you don't believe this, listen to the news). She backs up all her arguments with researched facts.   I bet all her critiques who attack her book won't look up any of the resources or actually read her book, I dare them.  They teach tolerance, but are usually the ones who are lacking in it. Amen, Ann.  Don't let the name calling get to you, because we need you to speak out.  We need more people to speak out I am tired of the media, liberals, television and Hollywood controling our country. Wake up America and read this book.
A2APHQGT8QQQLI	April 19, 2003	1.0	Simply, all the reasoning in the book is written in a very sophomoric fashion. Gives a very small and closed minded view of the world. You will get plenty of childish ideas from this book.
A2EL9MAZRH33N5	June 27, 2002	5.0	This well written essay on American political culture is guaranteed to provoke a strong reaction from everyone who reads it, no matter which side of the aisle you come from. A blend of logically based political argument, mildly sardonic witicism and social commentary, Ann Coulter does some things few other authors do nearly as well. She clearly states her premise, documents and references the factual basis she used for her conclusions, uses nearly empiracal logic, and comes to final conclusions which are justified by the facts.  She does not make argument for it's own sake, but rather, has a point to those issues she addresses. I absolutely loved this book. At the same time, I know that anyone who doesn't share her conservative ideology will hate it as much as I loved it. Because she presents facts to back up her positions, and does so in a common-sense manner, it will undoubtedly infuriate those who take a different point of view, since it leaves little room to make an intelligent counterpoint. Slander is a powerful statement and an opportunity to provoke discussion on important issues. Ann Coulter is right up there with Rush Limbaugh, David Horowitz and other conservative commentators, but with a distinct difference: her strong use of  logic in making argument, and her "cut to the chase" clarity of expression without the hyperbole.  This book gets my highest recommendation. Even if you disagree with the authors point of view, this book is thought provoking and insightful.
A2LV1FY39YVL86	July 4, 2002	5.0	I'm familiar with Ms. Coulter's columns, and expected more of the same from this book. I bought this on a whim in the airport and read it on a long flight. Surprise: this book is superb. Ms. Coulter is one of the few columnists in America who cuts deftly through the paralyzing political correctness afflicting the U.S. She says what few will say, and it doesn't always work. This book works brilliantly. Her trademark wit remains razor-sharp, but this book adds several dimensions to her voice as a columnist. Given room to breathe, Ms. Coulter amazes with the sheer depth and breadth of her knowledge. Proof of her thesis comes fast with meticulous research and plentiful footnotes. She reveals herself to be an academic, a constitutional lawyer, and a patriot. This book will drive "liberals" (leftists, neo-socialists) mad -- because Ms. Coulter so clearly exposes them. Case in point: the single-star reviews that are more personal attacks on the author than "reviews" of her book. I visited Amazon.com the day this book was released, and was amused by the obvious liberals who had already "reviewed" this book before it was released. They must be clairvoyant - because they clearly haven't read this book. Invest in "Slander" -- it's a bracing slap in the face from reality that'll leave you wanting more.
A2QPL2LT6KA0MJ	July 3, 2002	5.0	Coulter's main thesis is that liberals have lost the ability to argue effectively and can only engage in name  calling and attacking the man rhetoric.  As you read some of the liberals writing reviews, you can see this thesis played out.  They are proving her point.   She footnotes every source, quote and claim.  Have you seen a liberal dispute a single claim she makes?  Of course not, they can't.  All they can do is call names.  Read the book if you want to find out why.
A2TJPZU65RJ1I3	July 8, 2002	5.0	Most of the reviews I've read, especially from the left, miss the point of Ann Coulter's new book, Slander: Liberal Lies About the American Right. The main point is that liberals don't argue ideas anymore, they attack people. The left's reviews of her book here on Amazon.com illustrate her point! If you disagree with liberals you are evil, agree with them and you are good. They are more self-righteous than Christian fundamentalists! If you are able to get by the metaphors, humorous pokes and even some invective, you should read this book. Ann does not confuse invective with argument like liberals do. Her arguements are cogently presented and supported with waves of evidence that only a person in denial could reject. Her invective only drives home the point. I think her book is important because it documents with hard evidence that the left is (as Andrew Sullivan and others have said)intellectually dead. The cure is many shots of reason and maturity, not to mention a great deal of soul searching, until the beast is in remission.
A35UV8I4U9U3B9	March 6, 2003	5.0	There is no middle road on Slander. Coulter packed her book with black and white examples of the idealogical differences between the left and the right. She backed her assertions with footnote after verifiable footnote.  This leaves the reader with one of two choices. Love the book because it exposes the truth about the intellectual void among the liberal elite. Hate the book because it reveals the cerebal dysfunction of the left wing establishment. Not surprisingly, those that choose to hate the book attempt to slander the messenger. Is this because they have no moral or intellectual ground to attack the message? Read the book and find out.
A3LYG1OCUG2OW5	December 18, 2002	1.0	This is the latest tirade from the swelling niche of extremist pundits trying to cash in quickly on the naivite and ,dare I say it, slanderous misconceptions of a misinformed public hungry for easy answers and a reinforcement of their dearly held prejudices through faulty data. There are lies, more lies and then there are Ann Coulter's statistics. She has a palpable hatred of anything that doesn't conform to her preposterous worldview where the only solutions to every conundrum are more guns or more Jesus. How long can it be until Ann and her ilk will want to arm Jesus to wipe off her adversaries?. Her illogical rants border on the hysterical and serve one purpose only: to stuff her wallet while prescribing sentiments that were already old and tired 50 years ago.
A3UQB6WDKPICVN	August 3, 2004	1.0	Ann Coulter is just being ridiculous, she used 780 "endnotes" to try to make people believe this. I cant believe people thought this was true, after all the lies on the right-leaning media (Fox "Faux", CNN and the others starting to copy, catering to the ignorant who choose not to wake up and realize how America has been duped by the government for their personal reasons. Thanks, Ms. Coulter, but I'm not eating this slander.
A4D8YRNM690DR	June 16, 2003	5.0	Ann Coulter is like the mythological cat.  I've read that the Egyptian Book of the Dead portrays the benevolent sun god, Ra, in the form of a spotted cat slaying the evil serpent of darkness.   Further, the goddess Bast was depicted as a cat, representing both the sun and the moon, with emphasis on the reflecting light of the sun, through the moon, providing the life giving light and warmth of the sun in the darkness of night. She is also depicted as holding the serpent of darkness at bay with bloody tooth and claw and as such was referred to as the 'Tearer' or 'Renderer'.   In Rome, the cat was considered as both the guardian spirit of a household, and the symbol of liberty.   Such is the case in Ann's relentless pursuit of the truth and her fervent passion for setting the record straight for the liberal minded BS artists amongst us out there. She is beautiful, elegant, intelligent, eloquent, and has a razor sharp wit.  She presents herself in writing with clarity, purpose, and  magnificent sarcasm - she is a very entertaining read.  If Ann Coulter is a fan of country western music - she is most likely the most perfect woman on earth.  While I admit a tiny gender bias and think that Toby Keith single-handedly resuscitated the nearly dead American Male, I'll give her Terri Clark as favorite entertainer.   If you love your country, hold dear your constitution, and fervently believe in American traditions and institutions, you owe it to yourself to read Ann's material.  I promise you will be enlightened, while being most thoroughly entertained.
A7RYEHMHT5LTZ	July 20, 2002	2.0	Ann is obviously dogmatic in her views.  She is intent on trashing the liberal threat in every aspect of American life.  However, she does this by making some unsubstantiated claims and unfortunate leaps in logic.  The gaps in her book become evident in her apparent fear of liberals corrupting the country.  She sees phantom liberals hiding in every corner, burning flags on every street, and plotting to resurrect Trotsky in a moments notice.  She obviously feels very strongly about her view, and she brings up some good points and issues that need to be discussed, but she reaches conclusions that she doesn't support very well.  If you want a book to get you fired up, read it.  But it's really just the conservative "Stupid White Men" by Michael Moore.  Both are good political candy in their own ways, but neither makes any lasting impression on the discerning reader.
A9P8XUWG3UTNC	October 16, 2003	1.0	Ann Coulter really embarresses herself with this book. In my mind it was just poorly written. I wrote papers similar to this in high school where I wrote one paragraph on a statement I make. This book is just a series of statements that Ann Coulter makes, writes one paragraph in defense of it and then goes onto another statement. She never supports any of her "facts" with "evidence." Though, she does make some pretty good statements which made me think even about my slightly left views. If you want to support your conservitive bias without having to think at all, read this book. If you want a well written book, read Al Franken's. Both have their excellent points, but at least Franken knows how to write a thesis, support it with facts, conclude it, call it a chapter, then go onto the next topic. Many times taking several pages to support his well-thought out points. Make several of these and you have got yourself a "book." Ms. Coulter, please if you write again concentrate on a few topics, talk about them, analyze them, support them with facts, come to a conclusion, then publish it. Slander was just an embarresment of American political literature. DO NOT buy this book, but maybe take a look at it... or at least get it used.
AI99GRH6PE964	January 22, 2003	5.0	Ann is a female version of Rush Limbaugh. As with any person who has given thought to their political position for more than 5 seconds (so I guess most liberals are out), you are either going to like this book (the conservatives) or you are going to hate it (liberals). You are either going to come away more reasons and examples against liberal arguements and the liberal slant to the mainstream press, or you are going to come away with even more hatred for convservatives. There is nothing really new here, but Ann does bring up some poitns that you may have forgotten or some stories that managed to get buried deep  or skipped altogher in the newspaper or in the news broadcast. As a conservative, use it as reference and a refresher, as a liberal, use the book as more reasons you are wrong.

AQ07Q690AVUOD	June 27, 2002	5.0	Unlike the so-called book reviews before my post, I actually did read the book.  Ann defines how vicious and vindictive the left really are.  She points a finger at who the real hate mongers are.   Interestingly, they don't even attempt to challenge her ideas by taking a different approach to reviewing her book.  You only need to read the negative reviews, barely a half step forward before what she says in the pages of her book become blazingly self evident.  The book is filled with quotes from seemingly objective news sources about the hate that liberal's have for conservatives.  All lies?  No less than 35 pages are dedicated to documenting the sources of all the liberal lies about conservatives propagated by the liberal mainstream media.  Following her well-documented footnotes quickly vanquishes any argument of "he said", "she said".      The compilation of liberal vindictiveness and sources together in one place alone is a gold mine to take to task your local liberal at any fireside debate.  She exposes the liberal argument's tactics, not to challenge the ideas of a conservative, but to simply attack the conservative.  By page 30 you get a documented idea of who does most of the real "hating" in American political circles.  A poster writes that she is "UN American".  I graciously beg to differ.  In just six posts, her patriotism and intelligence have already been questioned.  The point of the book is quickly proven.   I find it interesting that even with the detail at which she documents her sources, liberals will still call it lies while the rambling of some liberal writer without a single shred of documented evidence will be ordained as divine truth.
A11DAZQWPKXAM2	April 12, 2003	1.0	Ann Coulter believes that if you say a thing stridently enough, it will be true.  This entire book is an exercise in sophistry, and it's a sad commentary on American culture that she gets any attention at all.  Ms. Coulter is, in the end, a circus freak willing to say and do just about anything to get attention.  Do you really want to take your ideas about politics in America from someone like this? As Bill Maher said to Coulter a few weeks back -- when she actually had the gall to claim that George W. Bush got into Yale on his own merits -- Coulter just makes this [stuff] up.
A1AMOUDHAEFS67	December 2, 2002	5.0	I had never read a book that had so much research in it. Each chapter has a ton of footnotes. Once I started reading, it was very hard to put down. Not only informative, but clever, provocative and deliciously sarcastic. What a great mind! I've told my [friends] about one of the many points made in this book and they are now determined to read this book. If you consider yourself well-read, or a well-rounded individual or you think you are on top of your game; you really need to read this book to graduate to being well informed.
A1CLACEORRU1WV	December 27, 2002	1.0	Ann H. Coulter knows all about slander. You can watch her gossiping on Fox News. If you happen to know Sean Hannity, Ann Coulter could be his sister. If you hate democrats, maybe this is your book.
A1KL4MEJY3KYPR	July 4, 2002	5.0	...This book is well researched and well documented. The facts cannot be denied. The truth about Coulters claims cannot be seriously challenged. All of the bad reviews on this board are a testament to that. In keeping with the Clinton legacy, "Attack, attack, smear, attack."
A1T5MSCRLWDQSM	June 30, 2002	1.0	representing thier positions?  Sure, slander can come from left-wing sources (thus the "bleached mop" comment), but she has made a career (including two books now) based upon slader and ad hominem attacks.  Even her current book which attempts to blame liberals for wantonly engaging in such illogical assaults upon "sound conservative positions", engages in routine slander and missrepresentation of liberals and thier positions.  It's like Groucho Marx catigating comedians for using word-play to elicit a cheap laugh.  No credibility whatsoever. This book is clearly a self-indulgent tirade written to make right-wingers feel good about themselves and should not be digested as anything other than that.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.  Michael Moore's recent book does the same for the left-wingers (which also reached number one BTW).  But unlike Moore, Coulter's book is packaged and presented as more than this,which it is not. I am definately NOT sympathetic to her particular positions and analysis of the data she presents.  I find them to be unprincipled, selective, illogical garbage.  I am also NOT sympathetic to conservatism.  But I have read and heard MUCH more effective support for conservative positions than her comic book attempts.  If you believe right-wing conservative arguments are capable of standing up to those presented by left-wingers, then you have no buisness supporting this womans approach.  Resorting to such flim-flam Machiavellianism in the sphere of ideas only serves to legitimize the claim that conservative arguments are baseless and hollow. Have more respect for your views, and endorse a differnt mouthpiece.
A1TVCFKNRYFVXA	October 31, 2003	4.0	BR>Ann Coulter is passionately conservative, and those of you are are as well will enjoy her book.  This book will help galvanize some of your opinions on media bias and political dirty tricks, as Ms Coulter is an intelligent writer who obiviously did a lot of reserach for this book.     Many liberals will be turned off by this book, as Coulter is more combative and prone to attack liberals than someone like Sean Hannity, for instance.  However, the viciousness of her criticism is overshadowed by the cruelty of those she's criticizing.  At least read the first chapter, "Liberals Unhinged", and decide FOR YOURSELF if Ms Coulter gives these people fair treatment.
A26BRTW31FVP1X	September 8, 2003	5.0	Liberals can't take the truth, so they make comments about her appearance -- as if she'd have more credibility if she looked like Madeline Albright. Ann Coulter is the Left's worst nightmare, as this book exposes their treasonous activities of the last 50 years. Excellent.
A2Z96HAX81PQZO	February 9, 2003	5.0	Ann Coulter's book on the demonization of everything conservative is a slam-dunk, hole-in-one, knock out tour-de-force on one of the greatest problems facing our country. Ann thoroughly documents case after case of how the tools of propoganda have been exploited by dominant left wing forces throughout politics and  the media to undermine, dehumanize and eliminate all opposition. The sad result is the stagnation of any political process or dialogue which can actually produce the best end product in the public interest. Every worthwhile policy implemented in the last 25 years came about in spite of this stifling "blabocracy" and only through the dogged determination and patience of conservatives, helped lately by the promising rise of talk radio and the internet. Bravo, Bravo, Bravo!
A31K5E4XUULPZQ	October 9, 2003	5.0	Schwarzenegger is unable to be Governer because he "may" have groped some women in the past. Clinton however was fine to be Commander in Chief even after admitted oral sex in the Oval Office. Liberal = Hypocrite.
A336YAR7HT7EBH	July 7, 2002	5.0	Ann Coulter is so on target with this book that any died-in-the-wool liberal must cringe when reading it.  Most liberals are going to be asking themselves why they adhere to such a dying, hypocritical ideology.  One of the main points of the book is how Liberals cannot debate conservatives anymore without specious reasoning and insults.  There is no "we agree to disagree" anymore.  If you have the audacity to disagree with a Katie Couric or Gloria Steinam disciple you are considered a morally bankrupt person whom should not be heard.  Exhaustively sourced and very funny. Give it a try
A34299CN8PEPTT	June 30, 2002	5.0	Ann Coulter is very right in what she exposes in this must have book if you are a republican i doubt a democrat or liberal would read it simply because it exposes the truth something that liberals cannot take. The truth hurts the liberals in the worst way they dont have the facts or have any true ideas so all the clinton henchman and gore buddies and the rest of left simply just attack the person because they know they have no way to win a politacal fight. Im glad she exposed the phonyiness of left and the way the feel they are somehow above everyone else this book is one of the best books to really show whats really going in the liberal biased media with Dan Rather and many people at cnn only foxnews is the station that fairly represents the facts get this book it will enlighten your mind. If you are a democrat or liberal you should get it to if you have the guts to read it maybe it will open your closed minds too, way to go Ann not only are a very attractive woman you are very smart as well.
A3F1IWCJEA4AZS	July 30, 2003	1.0	The United States of America was created in 1776 by men of liberal philosophies.  The most liberal time this country has ever experienced was when it declared independence from England, demanded liberty and justice, and set about ensuring its citizens' freedom by creating the Constitution and Bill of Rights.   Liberals are so-called because they love LIBERTY, and they refuse to be limited by authoritarian regimes, such as one that colonized America.  They are broad-minded and open to reform and progress.  Had conservatives been more powerful in 1776, we would not have our own country today, and you would be singing "God Save the Queen" at the ballpark. You can thank liberals for the United States of America. So when Ann Coulter and her ilk denounce liberals and liberalism itself in their breath-taking displays of ignorance, bias and distortion, they mark themselves as enemies of America--traitors themselves.  They denounce the very people and philosophies that made this country great.  They spit on America's Founding Fathers and those American citizens today who cling to a fervent belief in liberty and progress. Ann Coulter is an attorney.  She knows the legal definition of "treason," and she knows that acts of treason are punishable by death.  Ask yourself this:  How can you take seriously anyone who charges MILLIONS of America with the crime of treason?  Who, if we are to assume that she's being serious about her accusations, would not think twice about rounding up every American with liberal beliefs and lining them up in front of a firing squad? She is either a lunatic, or a very smart woman who is playing the American public for all it's worth by stirring up the basest emotions of hate and rage and turning them into millions for her bank account. Either way, this book isn't worth the paper it's printed on, and anyone who takes this TRAITOR seriously ought to have his/her head examined.
A3IEE0C3XJ9QES	September 25, 2002	1.0	This book is another example of the eroding nature of political discourse in this nation. Ms. Coulter demonizes everything to the left of Newt Gingrich. No facts, of course- no substantive points. Only strawman arguments, half-truths, and flat-out lies. ...
A3L5STSVWTW504	January 27, 2003	1.0	...against Liberals. Lies, ignorance, and racism is what fuels Coulter's rhetoric. In fact, I'd be surprised if she wasn't on the Bush Administration's payroll. Avoid this book like the plague if you're interested in the actual truth, and non-idiotic writing.
A3LIN5T91YON6N	March 28, 2003	2.0	... ! For years, I have been frustrated and aggravated by the rhetoric that I've heard from the left.  I'm tired of the name-calling and the demonizing.  I'm offended when, instead of debating in a civil manner, they exaggerate and distort.  Throwing around terms like "racist" and "genocide," to attack anyone who opposes affirmative action, for instance, is irresponsible and reprehensible.  Calling it "censorship" when decent people object to their tax money being used to support "art" that desecrates religious symbols is preposterous. "Why," I wondered, "don't conservatives fight back with the same tactics? Let the liberals get a dose of their own medicine" Well, Ann Coulter does exactly that.  She uses the same kind of inflammatory, derogatory, venomous "hate speech" on them that they've used against conservatives for years.  And, having read it, I find that it's just as annoying and offensive even when it's used to promote ideas with which I agree. On reflection, I think that it's beneath the values of the Republican Party and conservative Americans to devolve to the left's brand of insults and mud-slinging.   I'd recommend reading Sean Hannity's Let Freedom Ring or The New Thought Police by Tammy Bruce, instead.
A8PVN928MNMGQ	June 29, 2002	4.0	One of Ann Coulter's points in the book is that liberals sink to name calling,propaganda, and lies to maintain power.  Reading some of the reviewers comments above was humorous in that they prove her point. I put this on the shelf next to Bruce's "The New Thought Police" and Twight's "Dependent on DC: The Rise of Federal Control over the Lives of Ordinary Americans"
ADPJGP4A9GLQQ	August 6, 2003	1.0	If I could give this book zero stars, I would.  I believe this is quite possibly the worst book in the history of mankind, and all copies should be burned.
AFD42DKM1AN3H	April 23, 2003	5.0	Coulter has written an excellently documented, straight forward approach to the rift growing in American politics today.  If you have ever tried to discuss politics with a liberal - and found yourself feeling like you were talking to a five year old who would not hear reason or even listen - Coulter has the explanation of why. Rather than debate, liberals have resorted to name calling.  No more can you even discuss a viewpoint other than an approved left view than you will be labeled a heretic and come under vicious attack.  Coulter documents, explains and hits back at those who use the same debate approach that they used in preschool.   Don't believe she is right?  Check out the other reviews on this page.  Had these people actually read the book, they might have decided not to come prove Ms. Coulter correct by attacking her personally instead of on the basis of what she says.  An excellent book this is highly recommended, both by myself and those "1 star knee jerks" who don't want you to read it.
AZV1FD2BS5OM5	July 14, 2002	5.0	Awesome.  Spectacular.  She nails it.  And I love that she dedicates it to the NY Times (which I, too, read daily, w/often the same outrage at their lies) . . check out her recent column...where she rips apart the Times' attack on Ashcroft and the 2nd Amendment . . . and shows that within 400 words, there are at least two times where you have to ask: 1)  Is the Times deliberately lying?  Or 2) are they ignorant of the actual facts, more ignorant than even your average junior high schooler? You go girl.  I wish some of the libs would cite specifics (I don't think they can, and that's why they don't).  The only thing you could take issue w/is her tone . . but sometimes moral outrage is appropriate.
A2K005676LJJ38	January 13, 2003	1.0	Wow!  I have never read anything so full of hate and bile.  This woman accuses "liberals" of a certain behavior and then goes on to exhibit it herself.  As someone who is considered very "conservative" on many issues and "liberal" on others, I find this book offensive.  Please, someone tell me this is a joke!  She could not possibly be a rational, thinking human being.  I suspect she is a publishing company's creation aimed maerely at provoking anger and outrage.
A2ROD71ZMXKUCF	May 7, 2003	1.0	Ann Coulter is one of the newest faces in a long line of conservative pundit entertainers. Her primary claim to fame seems to be her gender, as she is a younger, attractive woman in a field comprised almost exclusively of older, white Christian men. Her book Slander can best be described as a bitter, and often hateful, diatribe against liberals and what Coulter perceives to be liberal establishments, particularly the mainstream news media. The text literally overflows with petty sarcasm and spiteful invective; her goal is not to prove that conservatives are right, but that all liberals are wrong, bitter, deviant, and anti-American. And in the interests of book sales, she goes out of her way to be as sensational and obnoxious as possible.  She opens her book with the revelation that "It's all liberals' fault," and a few pages later states matter-of-factly that: "Liberals hate America, they hate 'flag-wavers,' they hate abortion opponents, they hate all religions except Islam. Even Islamic terrorists don't hate America like liberals do. They don't have the energy. If they had that much energy, they'd have indoor plumbing by now." This style, which some would consider to be merely an acerbic wit and others would consider outright slander, continues throughout the book. Coulter is the type of lawyer that amuses juries and annoys judges. Her arguments are colorful and emotional, but vacuous and devoid of fact. Like most pundits, she uses isolated, extreme examples (in this case, ultra-ultra-left liberals and columnists) to paint the vast majority of moderates as misguided and anti-American. She pads her book with an impressively long list of citations, many of which are taken out of context or misrepresented, and others which reference opinion columns and editorials instead of legitimate news or academic sources. Slander is not a serious political work; it's just entertainment for a small but vocal audience. Traditional conservatives will be disappointed by her rude demeanor (which hurts her argument) and slavish devotion to every aspect of current Bush administration policy, regardless of whether or not it follows true conservative doctrine (which undercuts her credibility). Liberals will see her as yet another bitter closet-fundamentalist wacko.  And moderates and centrists, who will spend the most time trying to actually analyze her arguments, will regard her as little more than an entertainer trying to make money by pandering to gullible people.
A3025YX5SGLSMT	October 3, 2002	2.0	This book could be summed up with:  "I know you are but what am I."   The best way to win this fight is to deflect the issue as Ann has done here.  By redifining the word Liberal and redefining the word media and if we use a different context of the word proof, we can show that 1 + 1 = blue. Although I hated sitting through this much empty rhetoric that I could have absorbed from two hours of mainstream mass media, I must recommend this book to anyone who is an evil liberal.  It is a wonderful text to use when explaining how conservatism communicates.  Conservatives once told us what to think, now they tell us not to.  The book does have a few errors and distortions as all books do, but is not worse than average in terms of writing style.  It is important to understand what conservatism teaches if you are to help someone free themselves (e.g. under conservatism, adding a superlative to a statement makes it a fact). The myth of the liberal media is a myth created by the media.  Ann is very much a part of that beast (are we down to 1 media corporation yet?)  The only way to make the propaganda machine more effective is to show that if it is called the 'bad guy', media conclusions are still upheld.  The other big error is that Ann considers Democrats to be the Liberals.  She fails to consider that many people, myself included, consider the Democrats interchangeable with the republicans (compare them to a Socialist or an Anarchist who never is invited to participate in CNN roundtables).  How does Ann chastise the media as though she is not a part of it? The truth is that the media will continue to cultivate their crop (you). Media will continue to sell this crop to the highest bidder. The highest bidder is the corporations that sustain conservatism. It's more fun to watch wars than coverage on the environment. Its more fun to watch sitcoms for hairstyle changes than learn about the perils of capitalism. It's easier to do what your told than to fight back. It's easiest to agree with Ann and not question her. How is a media liberal when owned by conservatives, run by conservatives, and given oversight by conservatives?   Look into independent media after you read this book.  It may explain much of how we react to the media since we are the commodity on which it survives.
A1H1SEYZLP8UBO	September 27, 2002	5.0	I am writing this review after an extensive study of the comments made by others on the page about SLANDER.  It seems to me that all the liberals say is that Coulter is doing exactly what she accuses the left of doing.  True.  I believe her main message is that too often in the mainstram media, the conservative voice is not allowed to be heard.  She is voicing a concern that is frequently not allowed or desired to be heard.   What I would like to hear from liberals is not that they think Anne Coulter is mean, unfair or unobjecive.  How do you liberals respond to the charges made by Ms. Coulter?  Is there any truth to the claims that she makes?  I think that the really sad thing is that while I tend to agree with her,  not that  everyone should agree on anything, but do you find that there is any possible shred of truth to the claims?   Is is not obvious that in certain instances there is a bias by some of the big time broadcasters?   Dan Rather is an announced democrat and has made some statments that are biased in his reporting.  Peter Jennings is clearly not a republican supporter and seems to me to have a very different slant when reporting conservative and liberal issues.  This is consistent with the entire entertainment industry of which network news has an incestuous relationship.  What bugs me is NOT that some of the anchors are biased, but that they would expect us to believe that they are NOT!  American Journalism would like us to think that they are some kind of paretorian guard, protecting us from the lies of the evil govenment and the rich and powerful,  they are not.  Frequently they make and create the news and feed it to the people who watch with a slant.  That is fine with me as long as I don't have to believe thay are feeding me the absolute TRUTH and to question the media is wrong. The way to avoid being influenced is to look at many sources and not just accept Peter Jennings, Richard Cohen or other liberals as well as not just accepting the word of Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity or other conservative hosts.  Look for many views and try to be realistic.  To me the value of Coulter's book and Bernard GOldbergs tome is not that they attack the left, but that they attack the people who push a leftist agenda under the disguise of JOURNALISIC INTEGRITY. I just think it is funny that either side finds a lot of fault with the other.  It is not really possible to defend Richard Nixon nor is it possible to defend Bill Clinton.  I just want to know how liberals defend Clinton?   As a conservative I will tell you that Nixon needed to be moved out of office just like he was and I believe that Clinton deserved the same fate.  Is there any honest communication possible? To close, read the book.  It is funny interesting and full of informatioin that you won't be allowed to get anywhere else.  It has a definite slant, but no more so than anything that the liberals of the media put out daily on network news or in the print media.
A1NP291IHRAC0P	July 16, 2002	5.0	Of course, those who trash this book would be crying liberals, wouldn't they? The liberal mind operates on lies, deceit, and covering up the truth. This book explains all that, and more, in great detail. Ann Coulter represents the new breed of, not only conservatism, but just plain ol' outright honesty. Thanks for showing us all the true meaning of liberalism: me, me, me.
A1Y2177FYOBPK6	July 11, 2002	1.0	After seeing Ann Coulter on Crossfire I borrowed the book from a conservative friend.  As a liberal I wasn't ticked off by the book per se, as I expected what I would find.  What ticks me off is that somehow a book like this can become the number 4 ranked item on amazon.com's sales list.  It's yet another of a seemingly never ending series of books - which all say the same thing and are apparently made up as the author goes along - bashing the political left.  Has America's educational system become so poor that the only stuff the masses are capable of reading is name calling?  Is debate and intelligent inquiry dead?  Perhaps so, and that is what upsets me most.   This book is one slander after another, therefore deserving of its one star for an appropriate title.  Truth be told, the media leans to the right and not the left.  75% of partisan politicians on ABC, NBC and CBS are Republican, and the newscaster typically agrees with everything they say.  Dan Rather, a supposed liberal has repeatedly said he'd do anything George II told him to do. The few Democrats on tv are usually defending themselves in some media fabricated scandal.  Lets not forget that all major news anchors gush over George II as if he's the messiah, supported his terrorism against the peasants of Afghanistan, kept Enron out of the news to keep his popularity polls up, and censored the results found in October that Al Gore won the election.  Save your money and visit a KKK or Christian Coalition website.  Their pretend quotes and statistics will say the same thing.
A20P3Q13EQRW2F	August 10, 2003	2.0	I consider myself a liberal.  I'm concerned about the alienation felt by people on opposite sides of the political spectrum.  I read this book with the intention of really trying to listen to what concerns conservatives have about liberals, but I was ultimately dissapointed about the content.  This kind of book does have a place, but if you're liberal and interested in reading about the issues that divide the counrty - this is not the book to read.  If, on the other hand, you share the political viewpoint of the author, I would imagine you would enjoy the book much the same way I enjoy Michael Moore's films. I'll limit my criticism to one chapter, the ninth chapter (Shadowboxing the Apocryphal "Religious Right").  She puts forth the idea that there is no such thing as the 'religious right', that it's just a construction of the left to rally behind.  At least she puts Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell down as people associated with the RR.  I would suggest that it's not very difficult to understand what people are refering to when they say "religious right."  It's not a conspiracy theory like the Illuminati (who really don't exist).  What we're talking about is that bloc of voters who side with the GOP primarily because of moral issues such as abortion, homosexuality, and (more at the local levels) teaching evolution and sex-ed in schools, etc.  These moral issues are framed within their religious worldview and do not come from a political ideology.   I feel that she engages in much of the ad hominem attacks that she accuses her opponents of, and that it lacks content of political depth.  But again, these books have their place. If you do not already share her polital viewpoint, you will not find a well reasoned apologetic for the conservative perspective or rational critique of liberal viewpoint (you will probably be incensed). If you do share her views, you will likely find this book entertaining.
A2B8SNYS96555D	June 28, 2002	5.0	As an open-minded political observer (and college student), I decided to read this book since Ann Coulter is always an interesting and entertaining debater whenever she's on the circuit. (Come on, how many political pundits these days can actually make you LAUGH while still communicating intelligent arguments?) The book provides a straight-forward insight into the world of the media, which without a doubt, has an agenda.  Her writing is colorful and dramatic, which makes it all the more appealing to read. Though her arguments aren't without substance- she does source all her information and quotes. (that's more to say than even some major news outlets!) So, if you enjoy politics or the news media- you'll definitely dig this read. I think you might even change your opinion about these so-called 'fair' journalists that Americans have come to admire. Even if you find yourself disagreeing with her ideologies (note to you liberals): you will admire her pull-no-punches approach. She's brave, which is refreshing. So before you believe the arguments that this is just another 'conservative' book- don't believe it, cause it's probably just more "Liberal Lies!!" :)
A2FUXNEIILQRZA	July 3, 2003	4.0	I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is well written and provides the reader with enough facts to clearly see liberals for what they are (and aren't).  It's refreshing to cut through the politically correct, "feel good" veneer of our society and examine the issues for what they really are.  The main stream media (perhaps excepting Fox) sidestep these issues and news anchors simply villify those who don't conform to their ideas of political correctness.   Let's put Hillary Clinton toe to toe with Ann Coulter and let them debate.  Whether liberal or conservative, right or left, majority or minority, this is a thought provoking and good read to consider.
A2YC2UMQ0FFJ01	June 27, 2002	5.0	Whenever Ann speaks, her Laser Guided Logic hits leftists where it hurts.  And they squeal loud and long to prove it. Truth is to a leftist as garlic is to a vampire and Ann is the "Slayer" of political commentators. They attack her personally, her looks, her motives and everything about her but one phrase that is always conspicuously missing from their whiney, wounded rants is, "Its Not True". Judge how well Ann hits the nail on the head by the virulence of their attacks.  How many books of political commentary do you see that have 35, yes THIRTY FIVE pages of footnotes? If you are a liberal/leftist who has been starting to doubt the anti-American, destructive, disproven, ineffective, immoral policies of your party as tens of thousands have since 9/11, get this book.  Peel back the veil (or turn over a rock) and see what the reality is, there is still time to do the right thing.
A3MRXD263DDVSK	June 29, 2002	5.0	Another review posted here complains about the lack of civil tone in Ann Coulter's book. Anyone familiar with Coulter understands that invective is her personal forte, but it is not as these other reviews contend, blind rage. Far from poorly reported, it is mercilessly footnoted, with many of the quotes of liberals damning in and of themselves without Coulter's help. Face it, people will buy this book because it is funny and because the subject matter here is cause for outrage. It is doubtful the negative reviews posted here were by people who actually read the book. More likely they are the people who can't stand the idea that anyone could ever question the liberal agenda as anything but the saving grace of all humanity. If you know Ann Coulter's work, you're going to love this book.
A3TTELRY7ANAK	January 2, 2003	4.0	She is a hard hitter for sure! But this work from time to time takes it over the line. She walks the line constantly (which is what make her so darn good, but from time to time she goes a little further then I think is true, a bit of over generalizing if you will, but most of what she says is head on and more then that... she's done her homework. For that she ought to be commended. There are few who produce such well documented works anymore, and she is good at what she does. Maybe a little more time perfecting it, we may see her go down in commentary history.
A7LUCB295I3BM	November 20, 2002	5.0	This website information has been hi-jacked by liberals who don't want you to read this funny informative book.  Get it and read it for yourself.  You'll never be the same.
AIWXBM4BZ22T5	July 5, 2002	4.0	Ann Coulter's recent work entitled, "Slander" is a fun, fast and interesting read for anyone who is at all familiar with the public battle in the media for the political hearts and minds of the American electorate. On the other hand, the now-infamous Borkean blonde bombshell crosses the line in far too many places, and in some cases, actually slanders the hapless and loony Left she so justifiably and consistently despises. As Ms. Coulter is no doubt well-aware, truth is an absolute defense to the charge of slander. And there is a grain of truth to many of the charges leveled at conservatives by liberals as set forth in her book.  Thus, in my view, the jury is still out on the issue as to whether liberals (and particularly, media liberals) are ultimately guilty of collective slander in their overall treatment of conservatives in the media. Furthermore, Coulter herself (and her conservative compatriots as well) are often guilty of the same irrational and unfair behavior that she claims characterizes the liberal attitude toward conservative political discourse.  In particular, conservatives in the media treat libertarians and their political arguments in a generally dimissive manner, preferring to use ad hominem attacks and name-calling rather than legitimate debate in order to "discredit" libertarian arguments levied against conservative inconsistencies. Moreover, much of what appears in Coulter's book has already been written elsewhere, most recently in Bernie Goldberg's book outlining the liberal bias of the media.  In my view, Coulter has simply reorganized and regurgitated many of the arguments and observations made by many other conservative pundits on this issue, and would have been better served by simply compiling excerpts from those works as a series of essays on the subject, and then taken credit as the "editor". Finally, the parameters of the traditional debate between "liberals" and "conservatives" is now decidedly shop-worn and irrelevant.  The true debate is between the advocates of statism (both conservative and liberal) and the advocates of liberty.  And Coulter's book conveniently ignores the nature and quality of that debate . . . apparently, she's afraid to look in the advocacy mirror where she would surely find the face of a statist.
AM3V2AHYWTXP	July 3, 2002	4.0	...P>First, I have to say that this book is a challenging read.  While it provides extensive footnotes for the quotes and statistics used, the book is interlaced with Ann's in-your face, cutting, and acerbic wit.  I think this clash of styles will make it hard for many readers to understand just how many of her comments are spoken with her tongue planted firmly in her cheek.  This books walks a fine line between a research paper and biting social commentary.  It does take some getting used to, but it is worth the effort. While I disagree with some of Ann's conclusions, I cannot argue that she backs up what she has to say.  A quick couple of Lexis-Nexis searches proved the accuracy of a random sample of her quotes.  It is hard to dispute the veracity of her claim of the demise of political discourse in this country when reasoned debate has been replaced with shouting matches and name-calling on Crossfire and the O'Reilly Factor.  In today's media, any political flack can make any absurb charge or claim and have it on the air unchallenged within hours.  Just last week in Kansas City, a spokesperson for Mayor Kay Barnes proclaimed her "the hardest working mayor in America" as she gave the key to the city to James Brown, the hardest working man in show business.  Surely Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg have had much more strenuous schedules over the last year.  Still, no challenge is made to this inane comment.  While Ann makes a case for liberal bias, I think it is safe to say that a lazy media is as much responsible. But I digress... liberal, moderate or conservative...Ann's book is a must read, in my opinion.  While she paints with a broad brush at times (which can detract from the strength of her arguments), her book as a whole will make you re-consider just how objective the news media is... whether you agree with their philosophy or not.  Statistics showing the NY Times has not endorsed a Republican presidential candidate in decades or that 80% plus of the media voted for Mondale when the general population overwhelmingly re-elected Reagan shows how out of step with the mainstream the media is.  When you hear pundits proclaim that certain politicians are out of touch with regular people, it makes you wonder just how in touch the reporters themselves are. This book has caused me to think critically as I read the paper or watch the news, and sometimes a healthy skepticism opens your eyes.
AR6X4RK49LPAH	June 19, 2003	1.0	It never ceases to amaze me how rapid right wing conservatives will FLOCK to whomever parrots the same, tired right wing dogma. I read this book in order to gain insight into the workings of the American right wing's mind.  Let me say that, despite reading the entire book, I failed to find anything more than narrow-minded sensationalism written with the intention of keeping mindless right wing ditto heads titilated and angry. Coulter, with her made-by marketers blonde hair is neither a scholar, nor an authority. This book contains shoddy research meant to satisfy naive readers.  Better to break down and begin reading the newspaper than allow Coulter to make political decisions for you.
AX3K8PQB8KXGC	September 25, 2002	5.0	This piece on what is wrong with today's liberalism is right on target. It is extremely well-researched (with hundreds of footnotes) and goes far beyond the name-calling methods of today's Democrats. And the best part? It is really quite funny. (You can tell it's right on target by the low rating given by liberal readers below ....the truth is obviously quite painful). The criticisms are indeed dead-on, for I myself believed most of the liberal claptrap for decades. Until I learned to read for myself. Thanks, Ann!
AXBJDM4WT7ABU	February 15, 2003	5.0	Reading this book didn't open my eyes to the liberal media bias in America today-- I already knew it existed. Instead it helped reaffirm my long held view that trying to engage in rational discourse with any dogmatist such as liberals, radical feminists, or even hard core Islamists, is a waste of time. Sooner or later, and usually sooner, the dogma-spouting true believers resort to name calling and personal attacks in lieu of reasoned arguments. Ms. Coulter's book does an excellent job of calling attention to such egregious actions as attacking conservative women based on looks, calling conservatives "Nazis" and "Uncle Toms", and resorting to invective as a standard means of refuting conservative debate. The fact that she used such meticulous research tools and endnoted her thoughts so well serves as a fine counterpoint to her admittedly antagonistic use of similar terms such as "Halfwit" and "Felon". In essence, she supports her statements with fact, rather than simply calling someone a name based upon their political views. In one of her interviews she mentions that originally her book was over 600 pages, and that she cut it down greatly in order to meet publishing requirements. I hope that is so, because it would mean that there are at least two other great books out there waiting to be published from this outstanding, thought provoking author!
A11WULB916KMG	January 28, 2003	5.0	Ann Coulter has given us a raw and unabashed insight into liberal thinking and rhetoric. She's a wonderful writer with a crisp wit and a way with words. Good reading if you are moderate or conservative, maybe not so good if you're liberal.
A1I03HODL58KW1	August 28, 2003	5.0	This is Ann Coulter's second book and she has grown by leaps and bounds as a writer, finally finding her own special voice.  Her third book, "Treason," is even better than this one (if that's possible).   This book will open your eyes and make you look at headlines, news stories, TV shows, movies, the entire media in fact, in a whole new light.  You'll start noticing the bombardment of subtle and not-so-subtle manipulation by the media.   Ms. Coulter gives examples by citing some of the major political news stories of the past and I found myself reading about oh, say, Senator Packwood, and saying, "Oh my, I had no idea that was what was really going on!"  (Apparently Packwood was useful to the feminists and groups like that but when his usefulness was no more, suddenly the news started reporting that he had been [physically] harassing women on his staff for decades, something at the time I thought strange .... why did they wait so long?)  You see, I, like many or most of the public had fallen for the lies and [information] printed in the newspaper.  Ann Coulter demonstrates in "Slander" exactly how the mainstream liberal media does it and by exposing this, shows the reader what to watch for. Since I read "Slander" I read newspapers and watch the evening news in an entirely new light.  One of my favorite "catches" is my newspaper printed an article about Rumsfeld coming to a local Marine Base and speaking to the troops.  And what did the headline say?  "Rumsfeld Grilled by Troops."  Need I say more? Read it, it will change you for the better.  It will make you smarter.
A1JX9VI4MMXEPB	September 27, 2002	5.0	Starting from a conservative viewpoint, Ann Coulter lays waste to liberals and Democrats across America. There is definitely some validity in saying that she hates liberals and this will probably put some readers off. The attacks however are always backed up by solid facts that are footnoted for easy reference. I doubt that she and Al Gore will form a lasting relationship anytime in the near future, but her documentation of his ridiculous claims ("I invented the Internet", "Tipper and I were the basis of the movie "Love Story" ", and "I started the investigation into Love Canal") would be hysterically funny if he weren't running for president. As it is, they present a tragic picture of a pathological liar. Very scary.
A22UT7FW80IQOG	January 16, 2003	1.0	how on earth this book has been hailed as an important contribution to political discourse in the united states is beyond me. i confess, i have not read the entire diatribe (I have better things to do with my time), but opening the book at ten random points and reading 3 page chunks (all I could stomach) convinced me that coulter is perhaps the most asanine of conservative commentators. while liberals have, for the most part, stopped whining about "media bias", coulter seems to think we still live in the goldwater era. she exemplifies the "paranoid style" in american politics wonderfully. truly awful. only for dittoheads.
A29XRZHDPSHTFU	January 6, 2003	5.0	Ann Coulter, is at her hard-hitting best as she exposes not only the hypocrisy and bias of certain liberals, but their regular use of outright lies to promote their agenda and demonize Republicans. How low will the establishment media go to discredit those who disagree with them.? It's a lot worse than you could have imagined. The exact quotes are here for everyone to see. There is no way that one can read this book and not be amazed at the lack of journalistic integrity demonstrated by many in the "news" media. Coulter's keen wit and take-no-prisoners writing style make this an easy read.
A322G2LOF8CV84	June 29, 2002	5.0	Yes I know it's painful for the tactics of the Left to be brought out in the light of day, but Ann has done it remarkably well. Awwww, does that hurt a few Leftist's feelings? Too bad, time to answer up to the baseless bashing the Left is so intent upon. Bravo Ann, keep up the good work!
A3ASCMZMXOG9Q1	October 8, 2002	5.0	This book puts to shame anyone who claims there is no media bias in this country. The author does a wonderful job of dismantling the most often used liberal arguments and deceptions. My favorite feature is that it is simply loaded with footnotes to back up the arguments being made. If you are conservative you will love this book. If you are liberal you will hate it, either way you will be glad you read it.
A62NQQ39G00V1	July 11, 2002	5.0	I have to chuckle to myself at the complete disdain liberal reviewers are giving this book...like we expect anything else from them on the topic!   The rants about a lack of balance, or this book being a vehicle for hate and lies are either written by those who have NOT read the book at all, or ignored the fact that it's designed to be a vivisection of the liberal media machine and the lies they help perpetrate about the conservatives of America. This book is very entertaining, yet still smart and appropriate.  A must read for any conservative looking for ammo for their arsenal, and a source for introspection for liberals, if they'd even try to read it! Kudos to Ann for her excellent work!  Every claim is backed up with documentable FACTS, and she footnotes each and every one.
AVN033JZXBP3D	September 18, 2002	5.0	I know, I know-persuading conservative readers that there is liberal bias in the media is like persuading Al Sharpton to have another doughnut. Still, it's good to re-examine the evidence, which is what Ann Coulter does in "Scandal: Liberal Lies About the American Right." Meticulously researched, with more than 750 footnotes, Coulter blows away the vacuous blatherings of liberal news anchors, politicians, and college professors. Dan Quayle slipped up one time and misspelled "potato." For this, he was crucified, pilloried, drawn and quartered by liberal pundits. But when a liberal politician makes a mistake, the press ignores it, or even covers up the transgression. Have you ever heard of these misstatements by well-known liberals? * Bill Clinton: "This is still the greatest country in the world, if we just will steel our wills and lose our minds." * Barbara Boxer: "Those who survived the San Francisco earthquake said, `Thank God I'm still alive.' But, of course, those who died, their lives will never be the same." * Janet Reno: "I always wait until a jury has spoken before I anticipate what they will do." * Al Gore: "A zebra cannot change its spots." * Hillary Clinton: "I'm having a great time being presi-" The main reason for liberal media bias is that many so-called "objective" reporters once worked for Democratic politicians. They include Tim Russert, Chris Matthews, Jeff Greenfield, Ken Bode, Bill Moyers, Brian Williams, Jane Pauley, James Fallows. All moved effortless into straight-news reporting jobs with major media outlets, and no one raised an eyebrow. But when conservatives, such as George Will or Pat Buchanan, move from the political realm to a media job, they are shunted into commentary jobs and are clearly labelled as the "conservative" viewpoint. Just once, could we see the words "liberal hack" appear under Dan Rather's face during the CBS Evening News? The media, of course, deny any bias. "Hearing media people describe liberals," says Coulter, "is like listening to a fish characterize water: Water? What water?" Whenever conservatives can bypass the monopolistic death grip of the newspapers, TV networks, and news magazines, they find a large audience among the American people for conservative ideas and policies. The internet and talk radio have become alternate news sources for many people tired of liberal bias in the mainstream news. Conservative books (such as "Slander") routinely rank in the top ten best-seller lists. But even these alternatives, says Coulter, drive liberals crazy and provoke them to censorship. A favorite trick is to hide conservative books in bookstores and in libraries.  What drives the liberal mind to censor, twist, and demonize conservative ideas? Basically, they don't trust you, and think you're an idiot who cannot manage your life. A New York Times reviewer said that Rush Limbaugh's "appeal is to a part of middle America-call it the silent majority or the American People or the booboisie." Calling conservatives `stupid'  is the topic of one of the chapters in "Slander." Other favorite liberal epithets are `racist,' `fascist,' `homophobe,' and `ugly'  "The `you're stupid' riposte is part of the larger liberal tactic of refusing to engage in ideas," writes Coulter. "Sometimes they evaporate in the middle of an argument and you're left alone, arguing with yourself." There's much, much more in "Slander" that will delight and enrage you. Reading it gives one a greater understanding of liberal psychology.
A1HM3V66RMTG86	June 18, 2003	5.0	I was thorougly impressed by the level of detail that Ann went into. Great book. It's actually scary to realize how biased the media is - it's a wonder that we've been able to get the likes of Reagan, Bush (W), et al elected, given the way the media attacks. I knew some of this stuff, but not nearly what is revealed here. Required reading for anyone concerned about politics in America.
A1IZXJ4GA939KR	November 21, 2005	5.0	Slander carefully and entertainingly documents hundreds of examples of liberal media bias. It is the best book I've read on the subject. It was very informative, providing footnote upon footnote of evidence. It also gives a great perspective of the alternate reality a lot of the liberal press lives in. Where the "radical right" is an organized monolith posessing incomprehensible influence and power even though, according to liberals, their ideas are so "out of the mainstream" it is incomprehensible that they would have any power or influence at all. This is just one of the contradictions Ann points out in her book. There are many more.  Detractors try to dismiss the entire book for being "inaccurate" and "sloppy" when the best they can do is produce an incorrect footnote or two. This is what you do when you can't argue substance. Ann has page after page of footnotes of examples of bias, but because two were mis-cited this is supposed to discredit the entire book? Only in the world of the liberals!  This is similar to Al Franken focusing that Bill O'Reilly "lied" about the exact technical name for the area he grew up in, while totally evading any argument on substance. Distraction is always the key when you can't argue content.

A27BF39MFZYLP7	December 5, 2002	5.0	Go over and read the reviews from readers of Michael Moore's "Stupid White Men" (which I've also read), then read the at least SUPPOSED "conservative" reviews of this book. Moore's book doesn't have a single footnote, isn't even well written, and is WAAYYY more over the top that this, and they just love it. Ok, so Ann's book isn't "nice", but it is heavily footnoted, and a LOT of fun. The one-liners are worth the price of admission alone. Excellent book, and a comparison with Moore should make any liberal jealous that we have Ann, and they only have a Stupid (and not very attractive) White Man.
A2TPK1TXF3OOH1	January 21, 2006	5.0	Coulter is clearly the best of the growing list of conservative counter-culture writers. Her biting wit and sarcasm is  a delightful change from the overtly politically correct pablum of the left. Coulter's insight into the left's crumbling domination of the mainstream media, academia, politics, and the entertainment world is right on.  Written in a clear manner, easily understood without being condescending, this book belies her extreme insight and knowledge into politics and American life. Coulter is an American first, a terrific writer second, and a treasure that has come to be discovered just as conservative America has been rediscovered. Her only match on the left is Camille Paglia. Paglia's writing comes from an angle of self hate and abuse, however insightful and biting her comments. You don't read Paglia and enjoy it. You read Paglia because it's a quick bite of Jalapeno pepper of a warm day depending on which side of the bed she awoke. Coulter, on the other hand, is much more cereberal, more studied. A much better read from a much better writer. Coulter's work will be around for years. The only measure of how biting and effective Coulter's work is can be found in the other reader reviewers on Amazon. The level of hate from the left tells you Coulter's voice as a writer comes across very strong. Read this book and pass it along to a liberal friend --or better still donate it to a library. We all need fearless, talented writers like Ann Coulter. Great Read!
A392XG8P2XU6TU	June 25, 2003	1.0	Ann Coulter's over wrought diatribe practices what she accuses others (them nasty Liberals) of doing- generalizing, over simplifying, and as she advertises in her title, slandering those whose ideas and ideals are anathema to her. For all of the hot air used to jump on centrists on American politics (while accusing them of being horrid leftists), you would think that Liberals ruled the airwaves, with conservatives not able to communicate their views to the general public.  Instead, we live in a world where Faux News puts up ill conceived straw dogs to be knocked down by right-wingers whose fingers controls the microphones.  Where MSNBC fires liberals and hires reactionaries whose pronouncements are met with joy from the right.  The political discourse is ruled by the rude (Coulter here joined by Savage, O'Reilly, Limbaugh, Scarborough), and heaven help those from the other side who resorts to reasoned arguements- they are shouted down and ridiculed, while the opposition is marginalized, and our rights are thrown into the trash by an unelected rabble, hell bent on self aggrandizement. Welcome once again to the Germany of the 1930's, ladies and gentlemen.
APY63AJ7FF197	June 29, 2002	5.0	No wonder liberals -- even those who've actually read Coulter's book before "reviewing" it -- are fulminating.  Coulter has documented her case assiduously; the footnotes number 36 pages. Even singular adjectives and short phrases that liberals have used to demonize conservatives come complete with attribution, much of it damningly and directly from the left's Holy Writ:  New York Times, Washington Post, Newsweek, NPR, ABC, CBS, NBC, et al.  For instance, take the case of libidinous liberal Republican Bob Packwood. Coulter supplies numerous examples of the effusive praise with which the left, feminists included, fawned over him when he was useful to them as a reliable pro-abortion vote in Congress. When Bill Clinton was elected and liberals no longer needed Packwood's finger in the abortion-on-demand dike, they excoriated his lecheries with self-righteous fury. The pages Coulter devotes to Packwood are replete with footnoted before-and-after rhetoric of the media and liberal organizations. Exposing the left's First Amendment hypocrisy in the "Samizdat Media" chapter, Coulter hits (P. J.) O'Rourkean and (Ambrose) Biercean heights with her mordant commentary.  The New York Times, to whom nude dancing and all-age access to pornography are cornerstones of First Amendment freedom, suffers the pangs of the damned when it regards the uncensored Internet.  Can't give our citizenry unfettered access to the likes of Matt Drudge, you know. If you can handle an unerringly accurate chronicling of the left's mindset and modus operandi, read the book.
A10AGB0HPDZHVL	March 17, 2003	3.0	Coulter's book is meticulously documented with examples of the excesses of the liberal media as well as those of their Democratic hero-leaders.  I always love to see the much merited bashing of the media's hypocrisy and double standards in print.   There is also some interesting analysis as to the liberal elite's thought processes.  However, style here is definitely lacking.  Coulter drives her points home with the subtlety of a jackhammer and overall this book becomes a tiresome read.  Her venom towards liberals is understandable, but she portrays moderate Republican politicians, and even some pretty conservative ones, as little better than bootlicking heretics.  Never in a million years would I have expected that someone would not consider Bill O'Reilly and Pat Robertson to be conservatives.  ...
A1TD142R0L35BA	April 29, 2003	5.0	Like a one-woman rescue party bent on recovering the priceless twin pearls of wisdom and truth, Ann Coulter clears a wide swath through the minacious, well-tended undergrowth of liberal lies and distortions which has been choking out verity and supplanting reality in American political thought for far too long, effortlessly smiting all manner of venomous leftist ophidians as she uncovers their dens along the way. Smarting quite deservedly from her direct, take-no-prisoners style, the left has predictably undertaken to obscure the invincibility of Coulter's logic and blunt her unassailable command of the facts by employing their favorite weapons: sophomoric derision and baseless character assassination.  Judging from the best seller lists, they are not having much success. Coulter is no pretender to mealy-mouthed diplomacy and she seems to genuinely enjoy being rather acerbic at times -- qualities which lend a certain vivacity, readability and authenticity to her work. Most conservatives will thoroughly enjoy "Slander" and the illumination it provides, but ALL liberals should also read this book!  The vituperative reception it has received from leftist mouthpieces alone is abject proof (for the discerning) that the left is frantic to supress it and enraged that their house of cards has been knocked down.  Liberals who choose instead to "drink the kool-aid" and pass up this opportunity for true enlightenment will have only themselves to blame for "not getting it" henceforth. Probably the most remarkable aspect of "Slander" is that virtually all of the incriminating revelations presented therein -- leftist lies, distortions, cover-ups, character assasination plots, and worse -- have actually emanated from the pens and lips of the guilty liberals themselves.  Coulter actually does very little editorializing, apparently preferring to simply amass and present the facts while allowing the self-evident truth to stand on its own bottom. For anyone not stultified by blind liberal ideology and idealism this book, along with "Useful Idiots" by Mona Charen and "The New Thought Police" by Tammy Bruce, serves to complete a compelling mosaic of the bankruptcy, malignancy, and felonious fraudulence of liberal thought in general (and the elite liberal media and politicos in particular) over the last few decades. Read them all!  Buy each of your children and grandchildren copies as well, and pass on something priceless: the truth.
A23QHSDXCZEFHN	March 7, 2003	1.0	Ann Coulter, America's Little Aryan Doll, is as silly as the "duck and cover" turtle.  This book is nothing but pages of whining lies.  Of course, if you tell the lies enough (e.g., "always fair and balanced") the non-thinkers out there will swallow it 100 percent.   All readers of this book should remind themselves of the following: 1.  In the 80's, Ronald Reagan not only slashed away at anti-trust laws, but he also got rid of the Fairness Doctrine--supposedly because it infringed on free speech (opening the way for massive buyouts of media organizations by conservatives). NOTE: Before Reagan ended the Fairness Doctrine, it was against the law for the broadcast media to be liberally slanted.  If it was, the media companies risked losing thier FCC licenses.  So much for that "liberal media" myth.   2.  Ronald Reagan was no idiot--he wanted to bring a right-wing bias to the mostly centered media (he didn't like the O'Reilly, Hannity, Coulter type of brash questioning delivered by Sam Donaldson).  With the help of his CIA director, William Casey (early Capital Cities co-founder) and other corporate big wigs, ABC was "taken over" by Capital Cities.  3.  Enter Rush Limbaugh and his EIB/WABC broadcasts (later, Roger Ailes--runs Fox News--produced Rush's tv show). 4.  Conservatives bought up AM radio signals hand over fist. 5.  Enter the Liddy's, Boortz's, Hannity's and North's. 6.  They are paid to keep the lies going by telling the "folks" that the media is liberal--over and over and over and over and over. 7.  Corporate America is in bed with conservative politics.  It wants its tax cuts. 8.  Corporate America would be foolish to spend money marketing and promoting liberal pundits that will get on the airwaves and trash corporate America. 9.  Where are the big radio and book deals for liberal pundits like Alan Colmes?  They're nowhere, because they can't get conserative corporate sponsors like Rush and Sean and Ollie get. 10.  Actual research (something the author has no need for) indicates a slant to the right in the media with the exception of PBS. One can only wonder who pays authors like Coulter to perpetuate lies.  Such lies only make fools out of the poor individuals who believe them.  Fortunately, when pundits like Coulter are actually face-to-face with "real" journalists, they flounder to the point of pity.  One shining element comes through loud and clear in this book: If the media isn't 100 percent conservative--it's liberal.
A2KI0XMTNAMN5W	August 22, 2004	5.0	This book was well researched.  The author uses her targets own words to expose them for what they are.  Its not merely a quoting of a few words taken out of context - she offers many examples.  Its an incredible read and one that will leave the reader a bit disturbed that such bias is so prevalant in the media.
A2UOK2H8BRA5FF	June 28, 2002	4.0	A famous person once said "when an argument is lost, all is not hopeless, you can still call the other person vile names." Many of the reviewers of Ms. Coulters book have done exactly that. Rather than critiquing the work honestly, they resort to name calling and labeling. As long as the author is hate-monger, homophobe, blond, Republican and conservative, she can be dismissed. These are the tactics that all liberals automatically and instinctively use to squelch public debate on their outworn, outdated and harmful policies. Read the book for yourself, and decide.
A306719E2N2KWD	June 29, 2002	5.0	Ann Coulter can write circles around Jonah Goldberg, Rod Dreher, and Rich Lowry at National Review and her departure from the magazine has made it much the poorer. I'm glad that as of this date her book is listed at number one on the Amazon.com charts. It restores my faith in the intelligence and common sense of the visitors to this website. Do us all a favor and buy a copy for every unfortunate soul that actually shelled out hard-earned money for that notorious and noisome jackass Michael Moore's book "Stupid White Men". Your purchase will be an effective antidote for his self-hating-middle-class-white-guy diatribes.
A31J13S8PNGTPR	July 1, 2002	1.0	from one who supposedly condems liberals for resorting to name-calling. as usual, ms coulter resorts to making page after page of outlandish claims (which she backpeddles from when confronted during television appearances). this is one of the most excrutiating reads i've ever endured. and lets not forget the fact that ms coulter wouldn't know a liberal if she saw one (she actually thinks that bill clinton, advocate of coroprate welfare, the wto, and welfare "deform" is a leftist!) this book is a blessing in disguise for liberals. the more exposure this vile woman receives, the worse conservatives look.  if you want the truth on liberalism and what it's all about, then i'd suggest giving senator paul wellstone's excellent "the conscience of a liberal" a read.
A3597IHMKKWXPV	July 13, 2002	5.0	I am not going to rehash the discussion in the last 300 plus reviews.  Just buy the book and come to your own conclusions.  This should be required reading for all incoming college freshman.
A39MHVNPF7PTRD	June 28, 2002	4.0	For those of you who are liberal, and have obviously not read the book but still feel like your qualified to critique it (a good liberal never lets facts get in the way of their agenda), the truth really hurts, doesn't it.  It started with Bernard Goldberg's Bias and continues with Coulter's Slander.  No one who has lived in the country for the last several decades can honestly deny what Coulter writes in her book. Unlike liberal arguments, Coulter backs up her arguments with historical facts and concrete examples.  How can liberals deny the race-baiting that occurred during the 1998 and 2000 elections?  How can they deny the fact that liberal debate on affirmative action starts and ends with accusations of racism and re-segregation?  To liberals, the debate on abortion is not about when does life begin (a serious issue), but why conservatives want to control women (complete nonsense).  Coulter's book simply highlights what ordinary Americans have known for years, regardless of party affiliation.  Liberal debate consists of nothing more than name-calling, demagaugery, race-baiting, and scare tactics.  Thank you Ms. Coulter for being honest, even if your book is, admittedly, a bit too venomous.  Unfortunately, your critics will use the book's venom to draw attention away from the truth, thereby putting form over substance.
A39SWAZR5RXG59	July 8, 2002	5.0	Wow, first I read the book and then I read the reviews!!  I can see why so many cranks are writing blistering reviews.  This book has more footnotes than my Ph.D. thesis and the reaction to this author brings home her point more than anything else she could put down on paper.  Suggestion for Coulter:  take the one star reviews and use them to hype the next printing (and the paperback edition) of this most important tome.
A3KDJ26FVAPHI7	July 8, 2002	5.0	After reading Bias I thought there would not be much to add.  I was wrong.  Ann Coulter uses many of the themes in Bias and takes them to a completely new level.  I believe this is a great book for anyone who wants to give an honest look at the media and the distortions that are given.
A3S3RVC0XN0Y94	July 3, 2002	5.0	Ann Coulters book, "Slander" is an excellent vivisection of the left. It cronicles the people and techniques of the major media, and how their biases and snobbery affect the news. Bernard Shultz's recent book "Bias" was only the prelude to Coulter's "Slander" which has far more substance. Coulter's analysis of the left's motivations was particularly interesting.
A3SMN4SL7A3T1H	June 28, 2002	4.0	This book will drive the far left crazy. Ms. Coulter does a wonderful job of exposing how pervasive the misrepresentation of conservatives in America has become. She supports it all with references, and adds a touch of her special wit. Well done.
AIMEHGACSPUWO	November 9, 2002	1.0	Ann Coulter, the tall blond vixen who used to sprew nonsense on Politically Incorrect, is at it again...doing what she does best.  Gripe. With such silly suggestions recently for the conflict with Islamic fundamentalists, (convert them to Christianity, after all, Christians NEVER kill each other), and a complete disregard for talk radio...dominated by formerly overweight hosts who reak of cigar smoke, Coulter takes on the "liberal" media.   Gee, where was she during the 90s when each night on the news we got a blow by blow description (pun intended) of the President's love life...a liberal's love life?  Coulter is dreaming if she thinks that liberals gather each Wednesday night to plot the downfall of this country with the help of Ted, Dan, and Peter....(we meet on Thursdays).   With magazines like National Review, The Weekly Spectator, and US New & World Report all having a slant towards the right, not to forget most owners of stations are conservative...Coulter's arguments fall flat on their face.
AN9GBK4BS13U1	July 3, 2002	5.0	All the 1 star reviews pretty much prove how biased liberals truely are. Tolerance? Only when they set the rules. The funny thing is, I pass by books that I disagree with... I don't read or review books from the liberals. But my-oh-my, note how vicious the "open minded" crowd handles itself. Amusing. Anyway, its hard to argue with the facts presented in the book. For all the cruel words- where do they find anything that was inaccurate?
A36M95L72DLRB5	June 27, 2002	5.0	SLANDER is long overdue!  To those who don't like Coulter's book, I suggest you can't handle the truth.  That the media is biased to the left is a proven fact.  That FoxNews and the internet have done wonders to reveal that bias is also a proven fact.  Hopefully the ruination of our country by America hating radicals is slowly fading. Wake up - America is the best.  If it weren't you wouldn't be able to rant.  You could live in one of the Arab nations where you would have NO freedom.
A3807C5FIL2E5D	June 27, 2002	5.0	I thought I knew of most of the instances of liberal bias by the media in recent times, but, boy was I wrong. Coulter documents EVERYTHING as she paints a revealing picture of the true state of journalism in America today. If you doubted that the media are overwhelmingly slanted to the left, you'll be convinced it's true after reading this book. Coulter uses a very powerful weapon to expose the bias among the media ... she uses their own, irrefutable words!
A3BYH1N1SVROHB	June 27, 2002	5.0	A great deal at twice the price. By all means spend your hard-earned money, you won't be sorry. Ms. Coulter sheds much `light' with very little `drivel' on the true nature of liberals and their extremely strident views. Don't waste your time with `tedious' left-wing hatchet jobs, this is the real deal. Much fodder for any freethinking individual.
A3D91U4W5Y51B3	June 30, 2002	5.0	This well documented book is a must for all who have believed the mainstream news outlets to be something other than tools for the left-wing radical movement in this country.  Having had a monopoly on news for many years, it's no wonder the left is up in arms over this undeniably truthful, hard hitting piece of literary genius.   Ann has hit the nail on the head for years with her brilliant columns, and has now brought that same hard-hitting wit and candor to "Slandered".   I recommend this book to all who seek the truth about the sad state of journalism in the USA!
A3E9LP1FEOTAM0	July 11, 2002	5.0	Hmmm, 213 good reviews, 79 bad reviews. Sounds like good ol' Ann hit the nail right on the head. This book details the fact that libs are incapable of anything but lies, attacking and name-calling. AND it happens in the one-star reviews right here, just as she said in her book. Upon watching her promoting this on the airwaves, it's nice to see nervous libs do exactly what she said they are famous for. The Coulter/Couric exchange, for example: Couric said a lie and she was caught at it (You aired the "Airhead" statement FOUR times, Katie. Not ONCE.) Nice to know that we "Evil," "racist," "homophobe," "redneck," "stupid," Conservatives have got the last heartiest laugh after all.  BTW, If you're a hardline Gore fan, this book might be hazardous to your nerves....
A3GAW6QVADBKQM	June 5, 2003	1.0	Anne Coulter follows a typical strategy of conservative "spinners."  She broadly criticizes "liberals" for doing what many conservatives are doing, or she broadly accuses "liberals" for having the reprehensible qualities of many conservatives.  This book lies about "liberals," and accuses "liberals" of lying about conservatives.  I must admit, this is an effective and persuasive strategy for those who want so desperately to believe blindly without taking to the effort to critically examine the argument and evidence (or lack thereof) for the argument...
A3IPUELEOSZWFZ	December 23, 2002	2.0	I consider myself a die-hared Republican, so I figured I would be right in tune with "Slander".  Instead I found myself bored by what I can only describe as a whiny rant.  I have never cared too much about what liberals say about my beliefs, and I don't expect them to care much what I think about them.  Ann Coulter would have you believe that every liberal is "out to get us" just like the wacko left wingers who think there's a big business conspiracy out to get the "little guy."   The fact is most people on both sides are reasonable people with different ideas who engage in sometimes spirited debate.  What we don't need is to revel and whine about our opponents views, and instead focus on building strength in our own convictions.  I have come to find Ann Coulter to be a right wing version of Al Sharpton.  She is the kind of advocate we don't need.
A3LB4I9AGYUILN	January 14, 2003	1.0	...  Miss Coulter's arguements number one don't add up and number two turn into rants of anti-liberal propaganda.  In giving many examples she forgets to show the Republican side that is sometime just as bad as Democrats. While neither side of the political parties is right or wrong her agruements that Democrats are always wrong are just plain nuts....
A3LF1VQ4Y6JXPO	January 17, 2003	1.0	More right wing media controlled garbage, worth ignoring, nothing more.
A3RN7X79ZOXPY0	May 20, 2003	2.0	Being only 16 I feel that I am still very open to new ideas, still deciding on the way that I wont to head when I am finally able to registar to vote. In preperation for what I feel is a momentus occasion, registration, I take it upon myself to read whatever political writings I find, weather they be in the newspaper or books. After reading Coulter though I was extremly dissapointed about her generalizations of liberals. Coulter makes statements claiming that liberals are un-american and hate this country more than the terroists who attacked us. I personally know numerous liberals who would lay down their life for this country because they love it so dearly. I also know numerous liberals who PROUDLY waved their flage after September 11 and have kept them up longer than some conservatives. Coulter lumps all liberals into one mass category. Whilist I feel that it is essential that all Americans should be able to vocalize their views I think Coulter went one step to far in the things that she said about all liberals, unless she is deliberatly trying to make enemies I would recomend that she stops and thinks weather her statement are entirely true before she decides to write them.
A3TT5R2QWCIZ0Y	June 27, 2002	5.0	How refreshing!  It's so encouraging to read someone who's not afraid to tell the truth.  Her statement that Liberals and media (possibly redundant) start with a pile of lies and it becomes impossible to debate them because one has to start from SOME truth.  We end up having to "assume" some lie as fact in order to have a starting place.  This is a must read.
A114AOVE1IZ4BV	June 28, 2002	5.0	Ann H. Coulter's "Slander: Liberal Lies" is nothing but brilliant. I have not read a book so backed by extensive research. It is a true and vibrant reflection of what the liberals in this country really think and believe about conservatives. A must read for anyone who wishes to understand what is really happening.
A12IE7LJH9MO7Y	December 30, 2002	4.0	I enjoyed reading this book because of the information that is never heard in the media.  Coulter gives the reader material to counter the biased media we are surrounded with on a daily basis.  I used to be a big blind liberal and over the last few years I discovered that I am conservative.  For many years people are brainwashed by the media, public ed., colleges, and mostly hollywood.  Coulther with this book and many others shines the much needed light on the lies of the liberal left. thank you Ann H. Coulter and look forward to future books
A16O14RNZRFMKC	January 31, 2003	3.0	First thing, I didn't buy this book, I skimmed through it in the bookstore.  The sad thing is, that many Americans will (silently) agree with Coulter's (ugly) viewpoint.  This country was settled by religious fanatics like the Pilgrims and slave owners, so its no wonder that right wing sentiment would be still be strong in good ole US of A. The irony is that the Left --- the brave liberals throughout history who fought for civil liberties, including the rights of women -- is the only reason that Ann Coulter has the right to express her thoughts and be independent (as every human being should).  If it wasn't for liberals, Ann Coulter would be home baking cookies, barefoot and pregnant and completely subservient to a conservative, abusive husband and society.
A1AGKE64Y8LTWA	June 28, 2002	5.0	This book is going to upset a lot of people who never considered themselves to be liberal.  The book is humorous and factual.  I suspect Ann is going to be getting a lot of the mind-numbed robot Cinton lovers writing bad reviews about her book.  It's ashamed even after Clinton is out of office the Kool-Aid drinkers just keep on defending the indefensible.  I hope everyone read this book.  Maybe it'll open a few eyes to see how the Dems play people for fools.
A1IN8ENNOM7VMT	June 28, 2002	5.0	I am a huge Ann aficionado and this book definitely doesn't disappoint. Just by seeing how many extremely negative reviews this book has already received in the first week makes me proud. Ms. Coulter truly has struck a nerve with scared liberals worldwide. The truth is out, and the democrats are scared. Finally the world can see how pathetic the American liberal media has become. No liberal figurehead is spared by Ms. Coulter. Liberal shills like Dan Rather, Matt Laurer, Katie "Eva Braun" Couric, the entire NY Times staff, etc are held to the flame in this book, and their slanderous lies and biases are dissected. Ann spouts venom at all those who have used their media celebrity to forward their own liberal ideals. This book is a must read for people who are fed up with the media's bias and lies. Ms. Coulter has finally wrote the seminal work which ultimately demonstrates how holier than thou liberals have used slander to demonize conservatives, and how they've been getting away with it for decades. When you control the media, you can control thoughts. Never again.
A1LZF09USHJN74	June 27, 2002	5.0	Ann Coulter's latest and best book brilliantly skewers the Left by employing the most sneaky underhanded method ever devised -- SHE TELLS THE TRUTH.   Especially adept at exposing the Left-Wing biased media who continually screams "We have NO Liberal bias" while unashamedly hiring Clinton Spinmeister George Stephanopolis to run their premier "news" show, (!!!) Coulter makes it hard for any reader of this book to continue sleepwalking through the Left's relentless minefield of media lies....  Like "Bill Clinton was a Rhodes Scholar" -- (actually, he flunked out of Oxford) "G W Bush is a moron" (actually, he has advanced degrees from both Yale and Harvard) "Reagan was an airhead" (who just happened to win the Cold War and end the Soviet Union, through -- what, LUCK?)   Coulter's best point is that the Left has not had an original thought since the 1960's.  Because of their total monopoly over the mass media, they have forgotten the art of debate and clear thinking, and now rely solely on name-calling and cartoon-demonization of Conservatives instead of, what were those things called -- oh yeah, IDEAS. If any book you have ever read will open your eyes in startling new ways -- THIS IS IT!  Fabulous book!!
A1M5FT81HYLA4Q	June 27, 2002	5.0	It is about time that someone has the guts to say the things she says.  I saw an interview with Katie Courik(?) and Coulter's comparing her to Eva Braum (Hitler's Mistress) was outrageously funny and definately made me remember why we have the 1st amendment.  Moments after that i rushed to buy the book.  Wonderful!
A1MAAER24RGZCY	June 29, 2002	4.0	Any person who reads this book with an open mind will find that Ms. Coulter has pulled the shade up and let the sunshine on liberal attempts at brainwashing. Regardless of what you may say about how Ms. Coulter says what she says, if you don't get into name calling but think and look at facts, you can't come to any other conclusion but that she is correct.  One perfect example of the bias she points out is the election night coverage of the major networks immediately calling States for Gore after the polls closed and waiting hours before calling States for Bush.  She outlines many, many other such examples.  This is an excellent book.  But don't take my word for it, read it yourself.
A1MPGQLESK5I08	January 13, 2003	1.0	In her attempt to document the bias of liberals, Coulter is the worse of offenders... and goes much farther than mere bias.  While her numerous footnotes (over 600) give the impression here assertations are backed up, any actual attempt to check those sources reveals their lack of substance.  Page one she writes that "(Tom) Delay is compared to savage murderers and genocidal lunatics..." inspection of the June 20, 1999 Maureen Dowd column, "The God Squad," that Coulter sites  however shows that she might be taking some liberties with the content of the article.  Dowd attacts Delay yes, but at the start of the article.  She then moves on to George W. Bush and writes about Al Gore directly before her "Crusades, Henry VIII, Salem, Father Coughlin, Hitler, Kosovo," bit.  In the real world she is speaking about Al Gore when those words get written.  In the world of Bias, Coulter lies. Speaking as a journalist, neither liberal nor conservative, Coulters' brand of ethics could be done without.
A1VH2GBCDP24Y7	June 27, 2002	5.0	For those of us who have long been aware of the Left's tactics of deceit (lies) and name-calling (hate speech), this book is sure to energize you.  With one example after another, properly footnoted, the collective picture becomes clear of the Left's contempt for any person right-of-center, also known as the vast right-wing conspiracy. Hopefully this book will help foster a true debate on ideas, a prospect quite frightening to liberals.  It is obviously having an impact as evidenced by Katie Couric's very defensive interview of Ann Coulter on June 26.
A1Z5MJUJXMVPMZ	June 28, 2002	5.0	This book is a well-written, witty chronicle of bias.  She uses example after example to prove her points in a biting but delightful fashion.  She tackles a serious subject with humor.  The result: a thoroughly enjoyable reading experience.  I strongly recommend this book to all!
A23HX3BILEUV3N	June 27, 2002	5.0	All of the people below that rate this book with one star have not even read the book (it was just released).  However, they realize Ann Coulter may hold a different opinion than their political correct indoctrination so they want to slander the book.  I'm sure they are convinced they believe in free speech, but in reality, they are nothing but facists trying to prevent you from reading this book.  Read the book and form your own opinion.
A25Y1ND7PHM4LU	June 27, 2002	5.0	I'm only two-thirds through the book.  She is definitely hard on the libs (particularily the newsies), no doubt about it.  But she backs up every opinion with example after example, footnoted throughout.  I'm guessing that the first 6 reviewers have not read the book (dem hacks, perhaps) judging by the lack of specitivity in their criticisms.  Claims that it is incoherent or illogical are absurd, as anyone whose read even the 1st 3 pages could attest. Fun stuff!
A2835W43Z13MU6	June 27, 2002	5.0	This book is a real good book. Ann Colter does a very good job of telling about the lies and myths of the libral media.  She says how librals like to talk down to religous people and to southerners because it helps them feel smarter and superier.  In the book she also talks about how the media is controlled by librals which is why she is never able to get on talk shows and she won't be able to advertise for her book.  This is a shame because it is a real good book.  She also talks about how mean spirited librals are because they don't like to argue with conservitives but they just calls them names.  In the book, she calls Katy Couric the Eva Brown of day time talk shows because she is so mean to her guests.  You should really buy this book so you to can learn about how librals lie and control the media.
A2AL6BMDQG0Z6C	June 28, 2002	5.0	This book hits the mark perfectly by showing how liberals rely on invective rather than cogent debate.  Just read the reviews here of those who don't like the book for more evidence.  They do not site any specific examples from the book; they just hurl insults and unsupported assertions.  I wouldn't be surprised if they haven't even read the book, since it was only released a few days ago. What are the odds that a Liberal is going to rush out and spend $[money] for this book, read all the way through it in two days, and come here to post a review? Not likely I think.  Coulter is right on when she points out the way media liberals make a feminist hero out of the virtue less Gloria Steinem while ignoring the documented accomplishments of the brilliant Phyllis Shlafly. For anyone who is truly opened minded this book will be an eye-opener. When modern Liberalism is defeated this book will be remembered for helping to expose its moral deficiencies and hypocrisy.
A2CY42PDPZRWM7	September 24, 2003	1.0	Drivel.  Pure and simple silliness.  None of this book makes any sense.  It becomes comical after a few pages because the author is clearly crazy.  This book offers no new insights, it doesn't do anything for the Right except make the Right look misrepresented by a terrible, melodrmatic writer.  In the ongoing debate between liberals and conservatives, the world needs more sane and true writing and less emotional, incorrect, revisionist drivel.
A2LXBVNRX02MBH	June 27, 2002	5.0	This is a fantastic book. This woman puts up with so much crap from the left because she tells the truth, and they are scared to death people will find out about it.
A2ZC7G03B8ESIF	June 28, 2002	5.0	breathlessly footnoted.  Every argument is backed up by facts.  This book is proof positive (and the above bad reviews) that lies and "slander" are the only thoughts the "left" have left to argue.  This book is simply genus!  This book does to the liberal - what Bias did to the Press.
A2ZIRFZTHE2IJ7	June 28, 2002	4.0	Although I prefered the last 2 books that Ann wrote, I found this read to be informative and straight to the heart. While exposing Dan Rather and Katie Couric as slanted and biased liberals is like exposing Richards Simmons as feminine, Ann took the time to clearly show the whitewashing of the Republican Party as fanatics by the mainstream press. I'm sure the folks at the soon-to-be defunct Salon.com are screaming in there sleep over this book. I think you'll find it a good read and worth the purchase.
A36OO0J6R1YX8	June 28, 2002	5.0	Ann is right on ... how many times have I seen a conservative making a thoughtful argument and the liberal debating opponent dismisses the argument with the statement " you're a bigot" or "you want to starve old people" (e.g.) ... liberals never want to use thoughtful arguments, just invective and and name calling. Ann points this out with examples too numerous to enumerate
A3QBCJOFKXWIUK	June 27, 2002	5.0	Ann Coulter has written a very witty book.  Several times, I laughed out loud.  She exposes the disdain the left has for conservatives such as Ronald Reagan and George Bush. She shows how the liberals view Christians: ignorant rednecks. The left has been skewered with their own rhetoric. Ms. Coulter exposes the lies told by the left and shows that the liberal establishment is to blame for the lack of civil political discussion in America today.  This book is excellent.  It is both interesting and informative.
A3QLFVF5O11E	June 27, 2002	5.0	I thought I knew of most of the instances of liberal bias by the media in recent times, but, boy was I wrong. Coulter documents EVERYTHING as she paints a revealing picture of the true state of journalism in America today. If you doubted that the media are overwhelmingly slanted to the left, you'll be convinced it's true after reading this book. Coulter uses a very powerful weapon to expose the bias among the media ... she uses their own, irrefutable words!
A3U010VNPW2EDL	June 28, 2002	5.0	An excellent expose that liberals hate to read.  This book reveals the very sad truth about the state of leftist politics.  They repeat the lies over and over again until not only much of the public believes it -- but they live their lives for it.  If you need a book that documents the slanderous ways of the liberal attack on our nation -- this book is a wonderful tool.  It is well written and a quick read.  The truth must be revealed and this book is an excellent resource for that truth!
AK5V4HEWAHFTL	June 27, 2002	5.0	Ann has outdone herself with her latest work. She has the guts to say what all conservatives think, but are afraid or reluctant to publicly admit. "Slander" does an excellent job of exposing the Democrat left as the dishonest, moral degenerates that they are. I am glad Ann is on our side.
AL16VLLHKWE7F	June 28, 2002	4.0	....After reading this book, which is very well written and researched (not lies), I realize.... What Ann says is true!  THEY RUN THE NEWSPAPERS, THEY BRAINWASH STUDENTS BY TEACHING HIGH SCHOOLS and colleges, they run Hollywood...Is that really what this country has come to?  If you're one of us, we'll help you, but if you're not, you're the enemy and we will destroy you? If your neither a liberal or conservative, do yourself a favor and buy the book.  You can always return it.  Don't give these activists the right to censor freedom of speech.  Listen to what she says. Ann is a fine writer.  She basically backs up everything she says.  She brings up important points as to what the media has been able to do, how they bias and throw elections and how they discredit Christians and the Right in general.  Basically it's picked up like a battlecry. My problem with Ann is that she sometimes lets her emotions take over her rationality and it's here that she screws up.  Notice I gave her four stars, not five because of this.  I am not a republican, nor a liberal, but voted independent the last three times.  I also didn't vote for president last time out. But these attacking and discrediting reviews have thoroughly convinced me that much of what Ann says about liberals discrediting conservatives is true.  She is a fine writer, with a very easy-to-read style and sense of humor.  She makes herself an authority on the topics at hand.   I enjoyed reading her. John
AZ8SVCSIBE1E	June 27, 2002	5.0	This is one of the most well worded and thoroughly documented works to come out on any political topic in recent memory. Ms. Coulter, due to the iron clad identification of her source material, is so far above the petty sniping of the other reviewers that it isn't even funny.    Ms. Coulter documents each and every word she uses from vicious leftists, no doubt because she was fully aware that vague name calling would be employed against her, and is the only weapon leftist bigots know how to use.    This book not only brilliantly captures and presents the true nature of the vicious left and their media cohorts, but it will also completely convince you that these people are simply mean. Five cheers (and stars) for Ann Coulter and her matchless literary style.
A11EAZYE8B9517	June 27, 2002	5.0	Ann Coulter is right on track in her analysis of the Liberal lies of the Republican Right.  The GOP has had enough...and the boldness of Coulter to stand up and fight back against the abusive accusations of the liberal mainstream and the press is praiseworthy.  Coulter is put down for pointing out liberal wrongs, but if this were James Carville making similar comments about Republicans, the left would be singing his praises.  Excellent book, a must read for America's true patriots.
A12BTJ8OYVFMCE	July 1, 2002	5.0	I read the entire book, cover to cover.  Based on the other reviews, I think that is a valid point to start with. The book contained almost 40 pages of references alone.  This was a well reasoned book with a great deal of supporting evidence.  The supporting evidence is well documented and can be verified by anyone, including exactly where the sources are found, LexisNexis. The book was amusing to read and kept you going most of the time.  There were points at which it felt a bit belabored.  I do not think this is so much a fault of the author, but more a result of the content.  It indicates the constant repetition of the media in their treatment of conservatives, using the same old adjectives over and over. I particularly liked the discussion of the religious right.  It is absolutely hilarious to hear the media constantly talk about it as though it is an actual organization with members and leadership, etc. To be part of the 'religious right', you need only 2 things, 1. Be an evangelical christian, 2. Be a Republican. There is no central leadership, not Buchanan, Robertson, Falwell, or Bauer.  There is no yearly dues, no organized bloc voting, no secret meetings.  It is just a subset of unaffiliated people who are socially conservative and fiscally conservative. In closing, the book was interesting, it was well documented, and it was accurate.  It could have been 30 pages shorter, as the extra content was alot more of the same, which re-enforced the point of how pervasive this 'slander' is, but did make for a bit much repetition.
A146WM69SYFWMH	July 3, 2002	5.0	Liberals, be afraid.  Be very afraid.  Ann Coulter has "out-ed" the methodology, the motivation, and the neurosis of liberals both in the media and in politics.  She takes no prisoners in this volume that follows perfectly on the heels of Bernie Goldberg's "Bias".  This volume is amazingly well documented.  Ann has worn Nexis Lexis out!  She demonstrates with vigor and credibility how Democrats and liberals have lost the ability to debate issues.  Inspiring!
A1COLG6BAE6Z3E	December 11, 2002	1.0	There are a lot of lies in here, and they're all courtesy of Ann Coulter.  For a woman who complains that liberals do nothing but attack their enemies, she does nothing but attack her enemies with seemingly endless streams of senseless right-wing propaganda.  I see no reason for anyone to buy this book, or spend any time reading it; for conservatives, there are many well-written and well-thought out works available from intelligent authors who take up conservative stances, and liberals can better spend their time working for social justice, sustainable economic growth, etc.
A1DP28Z844PJK7	September 2, 2003	4.0	Conservative writer Ann Coulter does not mince words about her ideological opposition.  She learnt from the liberals their way of attacking the opposition - vitriol, some exaggeration and far-reaching conclusions; however, she adds something that liberals totally forget - she backs her writing with the facts. Page after page is devoted to exploring and refuting liberal ideology and arguments.  It is richly spiced-up with humor and examples of liberals time and time again taking the side of the enemies of US against their own country.  No matter who the opposing side is, be it Communists, Moslem fundamentalists, Black Panthers, or plain old Central Park rapists - liberals take their side and bash America, conservatives,  capitalism, and anything that represents traditional American society.  Ann Coulter exposes it time and time again with the examples and quotes of various liberal pundits. Author sheds a light on the fact that in almost any public debate liberals have not offered valid arguments, it is always "stupidity" of their opponents that they attack.  "Stupid" Ronald Reagan destroyed Soviet Communism, "stupid" Bush Sr. liberated Kuwait, and saved US from the imminent fuel shortage crisis, "stupid" G.W. Bush is leading war on terror.  Liberals have criticized all of them, but never offered an alternative solution, with the exception of giving in to the demands of the enemies whenever possible.  Ann Coulter explores this issue in great detail. The reason I gave "Slander" four stars instead of five is because it is one-sided and contains some vitriol.  Nonetheless, it is a book that sheds light on the myths that have been forced upon America by the politically correct, liberal Democratic party that would rather explore why all kinds of terrorists, criminals, and Islamists and Communists hate us and how we can appease them rather than oppose them.
A1EAVOPOQTEKB5	June 28, 2002	5.0	Unlike others who have posted reviews here, I have actually read the book.  It is brilliant.   Coulter mixes her scathing wit with an overwhelming amount of evidence to make her case that liberals are incapable of dealing with facts and attempt to dismiss them by demonizing the messanger.  Nearly half of the book is composed of footnotes and documentation.   So go read the book and then re-read these 1-star reviews.  You'll get a big chuckle over how correct she is.
A1EYULXUQJNYYU	June 27, 2002	5.0	I loved this book.  A refreshng change from the liberal bias found in so much of today's media. The book is poigant and funny at the same time. Her ability to expose the liberal Democrates in Washington DC for what they are, enemies of the hard working American, is masterful.
A1J5N22VYR65CX	July 5, 2002	1.0	Ann Coulter is an embarrassment to the right. She uses every lowdown slimy trick in the liberal book to sell hers. She's absolutely no better than they are and this book clearly shows that. I thought she might have something new to add to political awareness or that she might have a fresh perspective on politics in general, NOT! This book is just a rehash of the same old ... spun on television ever night of the week. Republicans and conservatives do not need to sink as low as Ann Coulter goes in this book, which is written in textbook liberal bleeding heart fashion. It's a ... sham that this self proclaimed representative of the right has chosen to drag the image of conservatism down to the depths of liberal ... throwing to put a few bucks in her purse. Maybe the liberals can somehow find a way to sue her for copyright infringement.
A1K5ELY3EHS8SX	July 16, 2002	5.0	If you're a Republican, you'll love this book.  Page after page of well-documented examples of liberal and DNC slander against conservatives and the GOP.  The 35 or so pages of footnotes at the back of the book are a great example of the research and examination of facts sadly lacking in a lot of contemporary political writers.  Ann Coulter fires off on the bias and slander found throughout the mainstream media directed at the American political right.  If you're a liberal, watch out!  Ann skewers your politics thoroughly on just about every fascinating page.
A1L2NKENWUSAQA	June 29, 2002	5.0	In the misty realm of the Liberal left, towing the party line is safe and the flock huddles together. Conservatives as a rule may not be as blunt as Ann Coulter, and sadly, too often take the diplomatic high road approach. Rather than be mocked by the leftist flock, they hope mankind will come to obvious, reasonable conclusions. Coulter minces no words but slices with precision. Not intimidated by the liberals nor content to play the silent diplomat, her book moves quickly to the core of the current state of affairs. Wielding her pen she strikes where too many are fearful to go. Coulter names issues, names the individuals, and summarizes well. Ann Coulter connects, hitting the bulls-eye in "Slander." Coulter's book does not rehash and rehaze the rhetoric cleverly peddled as truth by mainstream media. She holds her own and clears the mist for all who dare take an honest look.
A1LECEIU49C6LJ	June 27, 2002	5.0	Ann's book clearly illustrates the political elite and media bias that is practiced on the left and right coasts.  It seems to be that any time a liberal is losing an argument against a conservative, that same liberal resorts to name calling and personal attacks.  Thanks, Ann, for shining the light of truth and making the liberals squirm. You go, girl!
A1MHS1HEQ2TBYV	June 26, 2002	5.0	Ever wanted to call out a liberal on one of their illogical positions, be it social or fiscal?  Ann Coulter not only brings out the truth in the liberal media slant but makes delicious arguments based totally on well-documented FACTS.  Sure, there's a good degree of spin; remember, Ann has NEVER pretended to be an "objective journalist".  She, like Rush Limbaugh is a proud Republican and makes no attempts to ever hide that fact and that they're both conservative analysts and commontators.  She uncovers the deception in the media as those with the liberal agenda hide behind their "objectivity" and says "B.S.!"  So, Ann is perfectly able to deliver her opinion from well researched point of view instead of from mere passion.  There is much entertainment and humor value in this novel; you'll laugh one page and be surprised the next.  Ann is unpredictable as she can switch off the sexy charm and whip out the venom in lightning speed, which is what makes her so dangerous and feared by liberals.  This is great work!
A1NC4K1RJ99917	March 17, 2003	1.0	I don't have the time or energy to go into everything the new darling of the right got wrong in this book.  There are plenty of resources on the internet that can do that for you. If you're going to read this, check it out from a library or borrow it from someone like I did.  Don't waste your money. If you're already convinced that all liberals are just evil to the core, diabolically planning the destruction of America and everything good in the world- then you'll be convinced.  If you feel good about reading how stupid everyone who disagrees with you is, then read on.  If you want to actually learn something, research the subject of politics, or just receive accurate information, this is not the book for you.... How can someone who makes statements like "Invade their (Arab) countries, kill their leaders, and convert them to Christianity" and who jokes about how she wishes Timothy McVeigh had blown up the New York Times building before being caught even be treated seriously by the American public? If conservatives were more interested in actually learning about the world in which they live, rather than constantly assuring themselves that their gut instincts are right, this country may be able to progress in a socially conscious, internationally respected, and economically beneficial way. Check out the first appendix at the website for "What Liberal Media?" by Eric Alterman (read the book too) for a blow by blow account of how silly Ann Coulter and her book are.
A1P75C107WC4O5	June 28, 2002	5.0	Anne Coutler puts into perspective, a conservative one, liberal lies the American public hear everyday in our news sources, schools, and lawmakers.  It's a great book and she's on the rise so liberals and Dems alike should beware.
A1PRIYGJCSE4K9	June 29, 2002	5.0	Every conservative, moderate or other non-liberal KNOWS that the media doesn't portray their views fairly.  We've never been able to put our finger on exactly how they do this because they are very good at turning the arguement around. (In fact the media is conservative, just look at Fox and the WSJ!!)  Ann, finally, FINALLY!!! lifts the liberal's rock and exposes the slime underneath.  It is amazingly documented an amazingly thorough...   Every non-liberal should read this and every liberal too just to have a good long look in the mirror.
A1W4EGYK7YZ785	June 26, 2002	4.0	Wow! What a great book! Its about time someone had the courage to stand up to the tide of liberalism that seems to flood our airwaves. If Ann Coulter had not done such a terrific job at footnoting every single shred of proof that shows a liberal bias does exist, this would have been just another book, and truly unbelievable at that. However, with the obvious research and links of unbelievable quotes to their owners, there should no longer be any argument about if there is a liberal bias in the media. Ann Coulter won hands down! It will be interesting to see if television personalities change their ways now that the American Public will be on the lookout for anything that ditracts from a fair and balanced perspective. Great Book, recommend it to everyone!
A2897CSD3C9SBD	July 6, 2002	1.0	Coulter engages in the name-calling, fabrications, and character assassination that she maintains is the exclusive realm of liberals. She, like Limbaugh, et al, are bringing political analysis to a new low, trying to appeal to the lowest denominator of our nature. She is the radical republican attack puppy, nipping away and hoping something will hurt, wishing it will sell. Her statement that "an attack on America by fanatical Muslims had finally provided liberals with a religion they could respect" is just one example of the ridiculous and outrageous statments that make up this book. On an emotional level it may appeal to some people, but this book is a shallow analysis, and I am certain is being read for it's entertainment or "Wow!" factor. That's what I got out of it.
A28NRDGGIHZLSV	December 21, 2002	4.0	I consider myself neither a conservative nor a liberal. Being aware, however, of media bias, I do tend to form political opinions only after having heard the story reported from various outlets ranging from more left to more right. This being said, Ms. Coulter's book is one of the first I have read where ideology is planted firmly in the right. My first foray into the literary realm of the Republican party, proved to be an eye opening experience.  Not overly long and tedious, Ms. Coulter's writing style flows well from page to page, not without an underlying hint of controlled rage. Her arguements are well referenced and clearly spelled out, encouraging the reader to question everything he or she has heard, believed, or insinuated about the Republican party. I recommend this book perhaps as a balance to a book written by a liberal author, perhaps to compare and contrast both views.
A28PXS0N52VMTI	June 27, 2002	5.0	Reviewers seem to be missing the point of Ms.Coulter's argument, which she supports with ample documentation. She accuses liberals of "tu quoque" attacks which ignore the substance of conservative positions.  By tarring conservatives as racists, "far-right extremists", etc., liberals have, in an atmosphere of political correctness, not been called to defend their positions rationally.  Since 9/11 more Americans are questioning the assumptions of the left, and Ms. Coulter's book frightens and angers the liberal establishment because it resonates with emerging mainstream conservative sentiment.  It is a fun read;  the former editor of the U. Michigan Law Review is not afraid of a fight, but she has her facts straight.  The negative reaction to her book is precisely based on the problem the book illuminates.
A2AS6DFPD9C12Q	June 27, 2002	5.0	Ann Coulter is the kind of woman who evokes admiration. She's smart, clever, accomplished, and incidently, very easy on the eyes. In her latest book, she demolishes yet another lie of the left. "Slander" is a truthful, accurate, and cogent analysis of the inherent biases of the major US media institutions. It's a worthwhile read for everyone with an open mind. It's also sure to trigger the venom glands from all of those who are threatened by having such a bright spotlight aimed squarely upon the dark underbelly of the liberal intelligensia. You can see this leftist rote response in some of the previously written reviews of this book. Disregard them, they are advocates of deception. I give two thumbs up for this book... way up!
A2C03OQW9TKOTC	June 27, 2002	5.0	If you are a sensitive liberal then do not read this book. Moderates and conservatives will enjoy this book as it sheds light on the way that many on the left beleive that they are smarter than the general population and can make better decisions than ordinary Americans. If you want to think for yourself instead of having hollywood or the liberals in government do it then this is you will enjoy this book. If you want to follow other blindly and turn your money over then government then don't buy it. Instead send the money to the Democratic National Committee. They'll know how to spend it.
A2C21CLFKVZKCE	July 16, 2002	5.0	Ann Coulter has done an excellent job of flushing "sound-bite" journalism down the toilet, providing the reader with a multitude of detailed substantiation for inane liberal lies and left-leaning reporters.  "Slander" should be required reading for every journalism student and, dare I say, every journalist.  At a minimum, it ought to teach them to guard against the bias to which they are so shamefully wooed by flashy politicians.  Liberal readers will dismiss this book outright, insodoing fully supporting Ms. Coulter's proposition that they simply can't stand the truth.
A2DLJ7G57LQE0Z	July 11, 2002	4.0	I went into a bookstore and I couldn`t find Ann`s book. I looked everywhere. Finally, I decided to ask the clerk where I might find a "political book". She showed me a section called Social Sciences. It was well hidden. I fully expected that the NYT #1 best seller (according to Drudge)would be up front in a national book chains store.     Ann is brilliant, and she has strength, wit, and a profound ability to verify every thing that she writes. That is something that you will not find in any broadcast on national TV news programs. I cannot applaud this work enough.     I recently read Pat Buchanan`s book "death of the west". I then leant that book to 5 different people. They all loved it. I will not do that with this book. I want Ann to sell millions of copies and earn lots of money. I want her to have the money and comfort that she deserves in order that She can dedicate herself to her next work which I hope will be equally profound.      Additionally, regarding the reviewers who give only 1 star or even less than 5 stars concerning this book. They have got to do something about their diets. Clearly, these people did not read the same book that I read. Perhaps they should look at the water in their community, because something is so obviously wrong.
A2G2MYW9VQF24Z	July 2, 2002	5.0	The amount of anger, hate and name-calling coming from the "left-wing" in America proves the point that Ann Coulter makes in her book. Liberals hate the truth, and their only way to respond to it is through attacking the messenger, rather than presenting a well-thoughtout argument on issues and ideas.  Ann's book is excellent! It is well-documented, and like the lawyer she is, presents her case in a clear, concise and unarguable manner.  My only suggestion is, if you already are aware of the bias of the "left," read this book only in small doses because it will make you angrier than you already are!
A2L62SOK4RSQ5H	June 27, 2002	5.0	I have noticed that there are a lot of negative reviews about this book, and nearly all of them are from liberals.  I am not liberal or conservative (libertarian), but I enjoyed this book and am not surprised one bit by the liberal response.  The fact is that liberals do control the media, or liberal thinkers voice their opinions as a priority in the media...a recent poll suggested that well over a majority of Americans believe a bias exists...so her reports on this are nothing to condemn her on.  There are no books that are in the same light that attack Conservatives in the same way, and the reason is that they have no facts.  This book is facts, and she backs up every point.  Say what you will about her writing, but the content cannot be refuted.
A2NCE5ALM55FP	July 4, 2002	5.0	This book is excellent. Although I don't share all of Ann Coulter's positions on the issues, the well-documented facts that she presents in the book lend full credence to her arguments.  The book is both a source of fascinating information and of high entertainment.  It frequently caused me to spontaneously erupt into fits of laughter (which my wife found somewhat troubling). It so interesting because it brings a long-overdue perspective into the public forum.  This perspective that Ann brings to the public forum is that of cold, hard, objectivity, and it is supported with a vast arsenal of factual material.  I apologize for using cliche but here goes anyway: while reading the book, I often thought to myself "that is so true," and "I never thought of it that way."  I love the rare book that makes me think such thoughts.
A2PBZNRJ7MITB7	June 29, 2002	5.0	Well, I HAVE read the book, and I think it makes one point and makes it well and in several different contexts:  "Liberals don't try to win arguments, they seek to destroy their opponents and silence dissident opinions.  The monopoly media of television, newspapers, and magazines can inflict liberals on the public without paying a price.  Noticeably, however, liberals fail in any media realm where there is competition.  In the three media where success is  determined on the free market--radio, books, and the Internet--conservatives rule.  A competitive marketplace in speech has the ominous effect of producing Rush Limbaugh.  Only a monopoly could produce Dan Rather."         Read it and weep, Liberals.  Substance trumps form; content trumps style; the free market trumps socialism, and conservative thought trumps liberal emotionalism.   This is the same point that  David Horowitz has been making in his books:  socialists will never engage the question of socialism; they will only demonize the opponent.
A2QZU6YOGVEEI3	June 27, 2002	5.0	A shocking expose on the absolute control of the media by the American Left and the lengths to which they will go to destroy their opponents.  One wonders why others before her have not had the guts to blow the lid off of this story so clearly and concisely. Anyone who is still on the fence on this issue need only read this book with an open mind and they'll be hard-pressed to not have a solid opinion by the time they finish.
A2ULWJRGGK0IDT	June 28, 2002	4.0	In the never-ending debate between "liberal" and "conservative," this book stands out as an well documented and well structured response to common perceptions the left has about the right.  Few books articulate the frustrations of conservatives about liberal invective as well as "Slander."  As a conservative, I found myself reveling in Coulter's one-liners (e.g.,  "Indeed, the surest sign that one is dealing with a liberal is his refusal to grant meaning to the word "liberal.") and even challenged by her thinking.  As a regular reader of political history and thought, I found it very refreshing that her book was so thoroughly footnoted (35 pages of footnotes citing the time, place, or source of the facts that are the foundation of her arguments).  So many books of this type lack adequate references.  However, it should also be noted that Coulter implies all of the positions from the left that she cites (including news and commentary from major news outlets) is "invective."  And, her arguments are hard to deny without having a thorough grounding in recent political history.  But, this position is a bit ingenuous, as much of her own language is arguably "invective" by her own definition.  That is to say: snide, sarcastic, and filled with hyperbole.  If you voted for Bush (or belatedly regretted voting for Gore), you will love this book and find it refreshing in light of what conservatives see as the onslaught of the liberal ideas from major media outlets.  If you disagree with conservative thinking, buy it only if you are willing to be exposed to truly challenging points of view.
A2Y9SUDWWXXELG	September 3, 2003	1.0	This book certainly has an emotional appeal. By comparing people with liberal ideology to terrorists Ann appeals to her base of support. It is full of inflammatory remarks that might insight rage in you, if you are already very conservative.  The problem is, a lot of the book isn't true. I'm not sure why she did so little fact checking, but it makes the book nothing more than a propaganda piece.
A306UMAGM7DU68	June 30, 2002	5.0	Ann Coulter has brought to light how ambiguous and shallow the liberal left really is. I was raised in an all union, bloc voting democratic household where any trace of conservative thought was immediately vilified by my father, Mother, 5 brothers and 2 sisters. Them amazingly (probably some errant gene) I began to think for myself. Ann has managed to expose the lies and propaganda that lead so many mentally lazy ( easier to let someone else think for you) sheep to the slaughter of legitimate thought and open-minded debate. Thank you Ann an keep up the good work
A39YABROALLS13	June 28, 2002	5.0	Ann Coulter's new book "Slander" is totally accurate (check out the plethera of endnotes), honest, and an entertaining read.  Finally someone wrote a book that has documented the left's lies point by point.  I noticed that there were several 1-star ratings for this book.  That's interesting, seeing that it has shot up to Amazon's #1 book.  It seems that you ... liberals are complaining to yourselves....everyone else is too busy reading this page-turner.
A7EJ64AKLWV0H	June 27, 2002	5.0	I like sharp, witty rhetoric and Ann can sure deliver.  Like Moore she is a hard-edged partisan fire-breather.  Unlike Moore she actually has researched her book and, shall we say, "liberally" uses footnotes to document her views whereas Moore merely cut and pasted from liberal web-sites. Those on the left will hate this just as the conservatives hated Al Franken's and Michael Moore's works but for style and research Ann's book is a winner and a fun read.
AAJGOA5P18P39	July 16, 2002	5.0	How refreshing to see an overview of the scandal of the liberal leaning press, and media. I wasn't looking for a conservative hit piece and I am glad I didn't find one. Instead I discovered the biases were a much bigger problem than even I thought, as Ms Coulter so brilliantly outlines in this text.  Set your political agendas aside and read this as an observer, and it will scare the pants off of you. The problem is almost beyond repair. I'll now look for other books by this author.
ACW5WCXP99MJR	June 8, 2003	1.0	Seriously, Ann Coulter is the most ignorant and childish woman I have ever seen parade across the poltical stage. She has completely destoyed all my faith in ever finding an intellegant conservative--for she is living proof of the worse parts of conservatism: she is full of nothing but hate and believe me, your going to hear about it. 1 start though, because she contines to amuse me. When she calls liberals name-callers then goes around and say's something with all the maturity of a 12 year old boy (I keep expecting her to say "Bill Cliton is gay" or something), when she says liberals are obessed with looks then states she has never seen an attractive liberal, when she rips into the supposed liberal media (maybe in the past, but certainly it's not liberal now) then goes on any talk show that will take her--it's so sad, it's funny. Maybe she needs to open her eyes. Maybe if she was not so rich and protected she would be a little more in touch with the world. Maybe she actually thinks that what she says is funny and if this is true, I feel so sad for that tiny, tiny brain.  So, if your going to read a conservative book, read something else. Don't read something that is going to make you ashamed of your gender and of your country. Personally, I couldn't get more than a few pages in this book without wanting to rip out my eyes. I go to college with conservatives that write better than this. She is a disgrace to the Republican party.
AMOX1HTOESD1S	June 29, 2002	4.0	Did the other reviewers on Amazon.com actually read the book? It isn't William Faulkner, but it really is a good book that is well documented.  Being a media (especially newspaper) junkie, I was happy to see someone put into print the things I've noticed that big media has been doing for several years.   The other reviewers seem to resort to name calling, belittlement, and, well, slander, instead of giving an objective analysis of Ms Coulters book.
AS180APTJLTKF	June 27, 2002	5.0	Great Book and Fast Read. If the book "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus" taught us that men and women communicate differently, then Ann Coulter's Slander does the same for liberals and conservatives.  Ann explains how liberals handle conservative arguments and describes how the two camps approach public policy debate with quite different styles. Ann's on-the-mark analysis is supported by countless facts and sound arguments.  The extensive footnotes in the back of the book provide a treasure trove of primary source materials that alone make the book worth the money.  Ann's style and wit left me laughing throughout the read (though many of her conclusions of America's left are disheartening though not entirely surprising). Great book and a fast, fun read.
AUCH0VO4XQTJG	March 7, 2003	4.0	First off, I am more so a conservative than a liberal, but I cross over on one or two issues.  As you would expect, conservatives are going to love this book, and liberals are going to hate it.  Her hardest hitting points have to do with the media's role in the 2000 Presidential election fiasco, and the left wing bias in the media.  She puts forth a pretty persuasive argument.     Everything she has written is backed up by references, over 700 of them if I remember correctly.  On the down side, I would have toned down the name calling(I dont think that helps her), and when she refers to abortion as "baby killing", I just cringe.  I tried to review this book objectively, unlike some of the other reviewers.
AVR9VP98CXA08	July 3, 2002	5.0	Liberals were hoping that their hold on the media would continue but now the venues of Fox TV, Drudge, and Rush are uniting conservative Americans like never before.  This book is very entertaining and well written.  Ann tells it like it is and I really like the chapter on having fun arguing with liberals.  I mean at least people actually buy these books instead of the ones that Tip O'neil and Hillary Wrote (It takes a village to raise my Bill, I thing the title was) that got big advances but never actually sold any copies.
AZOUNP46YP7AO	July 1, 2002	5.0	Amazing to see the response here.  Just read the book.  Amazing.  Thank you Ms Coulter!  Our eyes begin to open...
A1C9ZY8FRWQ0TX	June 27, 2002	5.0	The liberals are not going to like this expos. But what she said is right on, it has been coming. Truly the liberals have controlled this country for the last 50 years, she is just bring out the dirty laundry that it was bound to come out eventually. She is bright, knows her subject. It is not wasting your money unless what she's got to say is bringing out a liberal biased side that you may have.

A1IHC56GTS83ZG	July 21, 2002	4.0	The only possible reason not to be impressed with Ann's linear thinking and well documented presentation of facts in her very sarcaustic style is that the reader is a liberal and the truth hurts.   Ann presents the left and their dishonesty in media in such a way that it cannot be denied. Those who find her book offensive will employ discredidation and more slander to undermine her presentation of the facts, thereby validating her Conservative views and statements of facts. Ann is an in your liberal face Constitutional Lawyer her knows her stuff and is a force to be taken seriously by the Left.
A1UHK39CI82GND	June 28, 2002	5.0	this is the best book ever, and it is absolutly true, all of these drug addicts on welfare gtive it bad reviews because they dont want to believe it, but everything in the book is true, its such a great book, i recommend it to all conservatives and libertarians, and liberals, you can go do some drugs, but if you actually can read, you can read it tootive at all, just a complete ....n ideas, a prospect quite frightening to liberals.  It is obviously having an impact as evidenced by Katie Couric's very defensive interview of Ann Coulter on June 26.
A1VHRAOBE2EGVC	July 13, 2002	1.0	Coulter cannot answer any of the liberal points of fact, criticisms, or arguments, so she instead accuses the questioner of being a stalker, an idiot, or a child.  She calls names and makes rude comments about people, in the same breath she whines about liberals being rude and calling republicans names.  Coulter, a leading conservative thinker and easily one of the most intelligent figures on the right, really steps up to show us all what a hypocrite and a liar she can be when slinging propaganda for the poor abused disenfranchised right wing in America..   She rails against the liberal media boogie man by saying that evil liberals distort republican positions by using inaccurate paraphrasing and partial out of context quotes, and to prove it she uses inaccurate paraphrasing and partial out of context quotes from supposedly liberal columnists and news anchors.  When questioned on these glaring hypocrisies and inaccuracies in her book, Coulter unable to address them, simply directs people to her book's 35 pages of footnotes, which upon review are found to contain the exact same kind of inaccurate paraphrasing and partial out of context quotes she's railing against. Then just to prove how liberals have lowered the bar on political debate with personal attacks and insults, she compares Katie Couric to Hitler's mistress.  Then to show us how liberals try to insult republican's intelligence in an attempt to dismiss their positions, she accuses liberals of debating like children to dismiss their positions. ...
A1WYJWW7S443V1	June 27, 2002	1.0	As a conservative thinker myself I wish that I were able to recommend this book.  Unfortunately, it is pure and simple trash.  Ms. Coulter offers absolutely nothing of substance.  Frankly, her inflammatory statements injure the conservative agenda by making us appear unintelligent. Her inability to express herself is actually quite embarrassing.  Clearly, she is only seeking to "cash-in" on her former success in criticizing Bill Clinton.  Moreover, her attempts to support her views on television made me cringe with embarrassment.
A22OSR9XWHRE1D	April 19, 2003	1.0	You can't take anything at all of what she says as "the truth."  Let's take a look at some of her famous quotes: To a disabled Vietnam vet: "People like you caused us to lose that war."---MSNBC  "[Clinton] masturbates in the sinks."---Rivera Live 8/2/99 "Women like Pamela Harriman and Patricia Duff are basically Anna Nicole Smith  from the waist down. Let's just call it for what it is. They're whores."---Salon.com 11/16/00 "If you don't hate Clinton and the people who labored to keep him in office,  you don't love your country."---George, 7/99  "We're now at the point that it's beyond whether or not this guy is a horny hick.  I really think it's a question of his mental stability. He really could be a lunatic.  I think it is a rational question for Americans to ask whether their president is insane."---Equal Time "I think we had enough laws about the turn-of-the-century. We don't need any more." Asked how far  back would she go to repeal laws, she replied, "Well, before the New Deal...[The Emancipation Proclamation]  would be a good start."---Politically Incorrect 5/7/97  "The presumption of innocence only means you don't go right to jail."---Hannity & Colmes 8/24/01 "Originally, I was the only female with long blonde hair. Now, they  all have long blonde hair."---CapitolHillBlue.com 6/6/00 we not only need to carpet-bomb every Arab country on the map, we also need to conduct a  war at home, especially on "swarthy males," who need to be singled out at airports and  elsewhere. "If National Review has no spine, they are not my allies," Coulter said yesterday.  "I really don't need friends like that. Every once in awhile they'll throw one of  their people to the wolves to get good press in left-wing publications." "Bush scored a 600 on his SAT, two times higher than Al Gore, a little higher than of Bill Bradley's." -Real Time with Bill Maher 2/21/03
A5QANO1C2EHFI	June 30, 2002	5.0	As a liberal, I hate to admit it, but my eyes have been opened -- Not so directly from the content of this book, but from others' reactions to it.  It was well written and seems impeccably sourced.  She goes out of her way to not take anything out of context as seems to be done to her so often.  I am puzzled by the brazenly negative reviews from other liberals that say she took everything out of context.  It was quite a good read.   In the past, I may have "poo-pooed" the idea that the media was liberally biased, but judging from the reactions of political pundits and prominent members of the media to Ann Coulter's book, my eyes have been opened.  I watched the interview with Katie Couric shortly after reading the book and was embarrassed by the blatant bias.  This interview  as well as other blatantly misleading comments and reviews only lends more credibility to the book. I must say that this book has directly and indirectly dealt a blow to the views I have held for some time.  I have grown up hearing the news reporting and taking it as factually accurate.  It's the news ....it is only fact reporting, right?  Though in recent years have begun to see some of the things and recall some of the things documented in this book.  This book helped me to see by documenting many cases of the bias in one place.  I wonder now what other cases were left out of the book?  Could she have strategically left out more cases for a sequel?  We'll just have to wait and see.  I will be returning my borrowed copy and adding this to my personal collection.   For those looking for an actual review to base a purchase upon, disregard flaming negative reviews.  I doubt they read the book, or read it with a closed mind anyway.  I highly recommend it.  Both of my thumbs are up. Once again, I am now embarrassed to have called myself a liberal.
A6WXVSLYV2F45	June 28, 2002	5.0	Some of reviewers here are proving Ann's point that you cannot argue with a liberal. Facts are irrelevant. They can only attack. Solid arguments and every quote, etc. is nicely referenced. Great read!

AZ6JSVJX4EMX5	July 4, 2002	5.0	Not surprisingly, many of the negative reviews of this book do not even address Coulter's main points.   Readers will either delight or recoil as Coulter systematically and effectively demonstrates how liberal ideology controls major network media and news dissemination.  The chapter over the post-election furor regarding Fox News calling the state of Florida for Bush at 2:45am (long after voting had stopped) is simply astounding.  I was stunned to discover that 18 times during the final hour of Florida voting, CBS announced that the FL polls were actually closed and that the state had gone to Gore.  (The other major networks had also called the state for Gore.)   Yet it was the Fox News channel's 2:45am correct Bush projection that received all of the negative media attention, (and was illogically accused of swaying the election.)  It is hard to argue against Coulter's copious examples of media bias.  This obviously polarizing book will not change anyone's political disposition.  Liberals will fume; everyone else will delight (and then fume over the liberal agenda being forced upon the nation under the guise of impartial journalism.)   Simply a great book.
A3L62P10P2NK7L	January 19, 2003	4.0	I am currently listening to audio cassettes of Ann Coulter's "Slander" work for approximately 30 minutes per day while walking for health.  She relentlessly pursues the thesis of contemporary liberalism and liberals as the pits.  As a political junkie, I am enjoying a poltical-social polemic.  I am laughing as the author trashes and bashes.  I have listened to the first two cassettes which cover several of the book's initial chapters.  Coulter is cataloguing contradictions.  She is highly entertaining.  Moderation is not a virtue.  She challenges liberal orthodoxy from appetite to a-hole/from a to z.  She is colorful and sarcastic.  She makes the case for Phyllis Schaffly as a gigantic intellect and influence.  Gloria Steinhem is sliced, diced, and de-constructed. Coulter explicitly pays little to no homage to the modern feminist movement.  The work is an unmitigated diss of what is considered liberalistic and radical chic (Tom Wolfe's phrase) today. I'm not gung-ho sold on her perspective, as I try to retain a modicum of objectivity.  For the brisk walking in the cold nights, I am enjoying the blunt rhetoric, despite or because of its emphatic, unambiguous, incessant skewering.  And I hereaby make a politically icorrect but mere human acknowledgement, as per her in-your-face candid vein of social reality, that it does make an impact on me that she is an unusually attractive blonde presence on tv. I am neoliberal, and so I can in neoliberal conscience award 4 stars to an heretical, offensive attack-book.
A164L142M2L92	October 20, 2003	1.0	This tome is a hoot.  Let me tell you that if you want to burn some calories, which will happen by  the intense laughing this treatise will impart on your funny bone, then this cornucopia of copius conspiricies is sure to please. I just don't understand though why Ann is so angry?  I mean she's got it made in the shade.  Oh well, her new pen name should be Ann Slanders. Tubby.
A2IIYDZ176W30K	January 3, 2003	1.0	Her epigrammatically styled rambling might be compared to the great American thinker/writer, Emerson, minus his genius, scope, voice, logic, style and depth.  However, it seems apparent that she wrote this dribble for the marginally intelligent portion of this country (You know who you are... the quite ones in the corner, not asking the questions but relying on "faith" and flags).  Her brand of patriotism sounds like a lot of circumscription to me, or the death-throws of the notion of white male superiority (as ordained by God and scripture), or knee-jerk, reactionary thinkers who would rather lob bombs than drop their jingoist stances.
A2IKKBRZ9S89R	June 9, 2005	3.0	Ann Coulter's Slander was very intriguing and rather compelling. I wasn't aware of the various tactics that liberals employ to  discredit conservatives. I also was a bit shocked at how liberals verbally bash conservatives, rather than discuss the issues  intellectually. The various strategies that are used on the poli- tical battlefield are very brutal and nefarious. This book was also an eye-opener for me since I am a liberal myself. While I  do see the hypocrisy in some liberal statements, I don't think  they are avaricious and relentless as Coulter portrayed them to be. This book was very informative, and presented good arguments. I would definitely recommend it to anyone: conservatives or liberals.
A2PCFTJQV53Z2M	November 29, 2004	2.0	Let me flat out say that I am a liberal and a Democrat.  I decided to read this book to learn about the conservative side of the story.  From page one, I lost my temper.  Everything she said stretched the truth and used illogical statements to get to the conclusion that it is the liberals fault for everything wrong in America.  This is the same lady who said that liberals are the only ones to call other people names and be negative.  This is the same lady who defends George W. Bush's intelligence.  For any conservative, go ahead and read this slander (because that is what the book is) because you will enjoy it.  Any liberal who wishes to learn a true represenation of the right wing would want to try another book.  I suggest "Bias" by Bernard Goldberg, which though is biased as well, does a much better job than Ann Coulter.
A1T60M7DZX7PIZ	January 14, 2003	5.0	Ann Coulter starts this book simply, but brings more elucidation to her subject matter by page 6. Her writing is witty, thought-provoking, thoroughly researched,accurate and detailed. Not only a highly informative book, but entertaining and shocking as well. A great read for those of intellect.
A26X1OF4GGW8TJ	October 1, 2002	5.0	Coming from an ex-liberal. Coulter has written a very factual, detailed account of what the liberal left thinks about those on the right. Her book is very descriptive with wonderful footnotes. I commend Random House for publishing this much needed book. The only thing Ms. Coulter might have added for those liberals who don't understand the logic of their ways would be illustrated pictures.
A2AB9I2QT18IEX	May 25, 2003	5.0	this book was probaly the book with the most foot notes for political science i have read so far. Because of this i took this book a little more seriosly and i thought there would be left crying from the left and they would see the error of there ways. Wrong!!! the truth is that no matter what you show to those people they will disagree with you and cover there ears and cry. Mrs. coulter did generalize alot but you have to realize that is part of politics, both right and left generalize about each other, and although the right has said some nasty things about the left they have not said that the left is "bigots, who want to put a burning cross on your lawn, and only care about the rich people and want to destroy middle class america" those are pretty strong words, and they are words i hear the left throwing at the republicans all the time. It really disturbs me and offends me how the left uses racisim as a argument against conservatives. Anyways if you are a conservative you will like this book and it will reinforce alot of beliefs you have more strongly. If however you are a liberal, then you will probaly not like it so you might as well buy Sydney Blumingthales book "the clinton wars" and you can read all about your favorite president and put down the "nasty conservatives"
A2DM4RYDQSO17O	June 26, 2002	5.0	I received this book from Amazon the day of publication (6/25/2002) having pre-ordered it.  Once I got it I couldnt put it down, and I was laughing so much my wife moved to another bedroom for the night.  There is humor everywhere in this book (sample chapter heading  The Joy of Arguing with Liberals: Youre Stupid!). Coulter is certainly funny, but she is also brilliant (law degree from U. Michigan, then clerked for a federal appeals court  a job offered to only the best and brightest law grads) and her insights on this countrys recent political history are fresh.  Even better, every example of liberals conduct she cites is footnoted, so there can be no question as to authenticity (and some of the items are so outrageous one would expect them to be fabrications).  Even some of the footnotes are good reading, and I enjoyed reading them along with the chapter to which they refer. Liberals have had hegemony over the media for so long that they have gotten lazy.  They dont have any original ideas and dont have to meet conservatives substantive ideas (school vouchers, Strategic Defense Initiative, welfare reform, flat tax, privatizing social security, to name a few) on the merits to be covered.  They can just label Republicans dumb and their ideas stupid and their remarks still get broadcast and covered.  Coulter proves this over and over. Liberals should read this book (perhaps getting it at the library to avoid paying royalties :>)) if only so they can avoid the bad rhetorical habits that so many on the left have adopted.  In these times above all, we need honest debate in our public discourse -- not name-calling, fear, envy and race-mongering.
A2QF2CNC5303F1	November 16, 2002	5.0	This funny, eye-opening book is required reading for any citizen who wants to be more critical of the information he or she reads & hears in the news daily. This book should also be required reading in every school of journalism, because if a professional journalist or reporter aspires to a high standard, he or she will take the lessons Ann points out & will seek a more objective stance. Unfortunately for the NY Times, a primary target of her attacks, the author critiques this paper's lack of professionalism over and over, and convincingly. (I stopped reading the Times about 8 years ago.) I just finished Ann's book last night, and Wow! I have believed for a long time that there is indeed such a thing a liberal bias in our media & society at large. But this book put it in far greater detail than I ever imagined, and with citation after citation. Just about every charge she makes she cites her sources chapter and verse. Her charges go beyond simply opinions to demonstrated inconsistencies and selective reporting by the media. I highly recommend this book. You'll never watch Peter Jennings in the same manner again.
A2UEGK84BSK34	January 2, 2003	5.0	Ann Coulter does a great job exposing the liberal slant on "news" coverage.  She has done her homework.  The book is well researched, and the facts are told in her unique sardonic way.  It is an easy read, and worth the time.  If you are liberal you probably will not want to read this.  Then again, if you are liberal, you probably do not read much anyway.
A2VFB83ZCQ317X	March 3, 2003	5.0	This book cuts right to the matter of the out of control liberal bias and indoctrination in this country.  The author gives numerous examples in razor sharp prose and for the sceptics she backs everything up with thorough footnotes and documentation.
A2X0YVEHKK8EYI	February 25, 2003	5.0	Ann's point for point dismissal of every liberal myth about conservatives is a joy to read. Attempts by libs to brush Ann off as hypocritical obviously do not get Ann's sense of humor and joy at getting under libs' skin. As great as this book has done in sales, it illustrates the point that many Americans agree with Ann and are elated that finally someone called liberals on all their pseudo-intellectual garbage. Ann is right! Those in denial of this prove that the truth hurts!
A2Z2GDU3ED32LQ	August 4, 2002	5.0	By far the best political book that I have read in years.  Ann Coulter has a way with words that has no equal.  Not only is the book extremely well documented, it is "laugh out loud" funny.  As she documents in her book, conservative books and authors are kept out of the mainstream, so don't look for this on Oprah's list.  Buy this book!
A338E4T7WSA30D	January 7, 2003	5.0	Ann Coulter does a great job at proving the case that 95% of the press has a liberal bias. Her wit alone is worth buying this book. Her intellect is outstanding. Her examples of how CBS, NBC, ABC, NY Times, LA Times, CNN, MSNBC, and PBS are extremely left wing bias are overwhelming. Buy this book.
A3AUP8I5XKTFGL	April 29, 2003	1.0	Here's the book in under a minute. "Liberals are stupid and the stupidest thing they do is call Republicans stupid because we're smarter than they are."  That's the book.  Really.  I'm not kidding. She's very precise about how horrible Liberals are.  "Liberals hate America, they hate "flag-wavers," they hate abortion opponents, they hate all religions except Islam (post 9/11).  Even Islamic terrorists don't hate America like liberals do.  They don't have the energy.  If the had that much energy, they'd have indoor plumbing by now."   Coulter includes 35 pages of footnotes painstakingly documenting her documentation of Liberal wrongs.  She must have learned in college that the more footnotes you use, the more impressive your paper looks and the less likely the professor is going to read the footnotes.  But following the footnotes yields untold treasures.  The best/worst is citing a gossip column in the Boston Globe that trashed Katherine Harris because of her make-up.  Does this pass anyone's standard for journalism? Here's her paraphrase of Jerry Falwell blaming 9/11 on gays and lesbians - "Falwell, it seems, had remarked that gay marriage and abortion on demand may not have warmed the heart of the Almighty." This is entertainment.  There's not a trace of plausible political thought in the book.  If you read the Weekly World News, think of Ed Anger in a dress.  As she says herself "A guy in a dress is hilairous".(p. 17)
A3HSHV73Q6DPR	January 22, 2003	5.0	Read the book and you will see how the left have control of the media and open your eyes to where this country is going.  As always liberals fear the truth, and will cover it with lies.
A3I4C25T54J8T6	October 15, 2003	5.0	I read the book.  It's a real page turner, well reasoned and engagingly written.  Missing is the wild, blind, hate mongering she is often accused of.  In light of the actual book, the accusations are ludicrous.  Her far-out extemeist, radical, right wing views turn out to be what at least half the country embraces as "Mom, baseball and apple pie."  Misquotes and out-of-context quotes slamming her are clearly intended to discredit and defame her -- and to keep you from reading her book... Why?  Obviously, there is a certain intellectully shaky idealolgy that feels deeply threatened by her expose style of writing and her well documented arguments.  I think what irks them most is her use of humor and her abiltiy to frame their actions in the light of thoughtful analysis (and a touch of ridicule).  It makes them look absurd, and if there is one thing fools cannot suffer, it's being exposed as fools.  As a result of reading the outrageously disparate reviews on Amazon, my 17 year-old son ordered both of Ann's recent books to write reports on them...  Ahhhh, there is hope for the youth of America -- Thanks, Ann.
A3I6TGLP75CAUT	January 15, 2003	5.0	Yes, I know, Ann Coulter comes off as bit of a hypocrite with all of the name-calling in this book.  However, in my opinion, if more conservatives would speak out against the liberal media and call them on their lies, maybe more Americans would wake-up and smell the coffee instead of accepting their leftist garbage.  I am sick and tired of conservatives jumping through hoops in their efforts to be the "nice" guys, and getting run over  (not to mention "slandered") in the process!  While I read this book, I thought to myself, "FINALLY, someone is dishing it back at the liberals and calling them on their lies!"  If you have any doubt about the left and how warped their tactics and agenda are, then you MUST read this book.  It will definitely open your eyes and clear up any misconceptions you may have about the "neutral" media.  The most interesting features of the book for me were Coulter's very thought-out reasons about why the liberals spin the way that they do.  It just makes sense and you can't argue with Coulter's points!  Highly recommended reading for everyone who wants to know the TRUTH about liberals!
ABV6GHMG5DCEZ	April 12, 2003	5.0	There are certainly books out there with a greater depth in terms of political analysis, greater coherence (Moore does tend to jump about from topic to topic), and there are political books with much greater academic credibility. And some people may even read this book and think the humour is childish. So why am I giving this book such a high rating? Is it because I simply agree with Moore's political views? Some I do, but certainly not all, and some I disagree with strongly. And for the record, I'm not anti-American (I'm British born and bred) or looking to endorse any anti-American view that comes along (not that I think this book is anti-American anyway). Although Moore's evidence and examples are selective, that does not bother me. What political writer is not selective or opinionated for that matter? Almost by definition, they all are. Every field has contrary evidence, and politics is no different. But at some point a writer will take a view and present their (selected) evidence. Moore is a passionate citizen. He is passionate about democracy and preserving it in the true sense of the word. He is passionate about social justice, economic justice, and he is passionate about the welfare of his fellow citizens. He doesn't claim to be an academic and he doesn't pretend to have written an academic text. Moore, through this book, asks questions. He asks why a CEO and other executives have nearly all charges dropped against them for hiding pollution which could cause cancer to thousands (after the executives admit guilt), while a man is given a life sentence for stealing because it's his third (minor) offence. He takes politicians at their word and questions them when their actions don't remotely match what they say. He asks why politicians will not respect the elections in Venezuela and then talk about the importance of democracy abroad. He asks why the US government has gone to war to reinstate non-democratic governments. Moore embodies the qualities of a good citizen, and his sin is to believe that in order to be a good citizen, you have to question hard what you see around you and speak loudly when you think something is wrong. If he gets called anti-American for that, so be it. But any country should be proud to have individuals like Moore bringing to the public spirited opinions, openness, some well researched arguments (anyone who argues with the level of his research, should just spend a few minutes looking through the `notes and sources' section at the back) and, for me anyway, entertainment. Congratulations Moore.
ALDIHNZDU72C8	March 23, 2005	5.0	Miss Ivonne's review itself demonstrates liberal bias.  She thinks she nailed Coulter for naming the book "Slander" rather than "Libel".  Coulter's book was not solely about print media, was it (Katie Couric)?  Talk about lazy, maybe Miss Ivonne didn't bother to read the book.  Secondly, the article Dowd wrote in June 1999 did not have Gore as the "object".  It mentioned Gore in one paragraph and it mentioned DeLay in five paragraphs (in addition to calling him "The Terminator").  Strange way of making Gore the "ojbect" of an article.  Read for yourself, do a google search using this search string: "+Maureen +Dowd Tom +DeLay religiosity +June +1999"  Lastly, she defends the media on the Bush AWOL story.  We are all now aware of the CBS fraudulent documents.  I realize she wrote her review before the CBS debacle, but it just demonstrates how wrong Miss Ivonne is, even years later.  Just read the book and disregard most or all reviews of politically charged books.
AP0CB0NE5VE97	July 14, 2002	5.0	Ms. Coulter hits the nail straight. And more than a few times. Her fast reading book is well stocked with fully documented examples of the half-truths, outright lies, and completely slanted outpourings from American print and television media. And her well known humor, sarcasm and wit are abundantly displayed. You would think that the success of books such as this and Bias, the trouncing of long established CNN by upstart Fox, the general decline of liberal network news(there's a redundancy), and the total absence of successful liberal talk shows would send a message to media management. Most Americans don't like your product: Give us something else.
AP5FHSKU070SH	February 27, 2003	5.0	This lady is brilliant,bold and beautiful NOT a bitchy,boozy broad as her liberal critics call her but they areso obviosly jealous of her wit,wisdom and total feminine charm they just can't stand it.Her book gives the lie to all the liberal propaganda in mainstream media.from (my mother hated america) Jennings to I love the Clintons&Sadamn--  Rather and I'll quit if you broadcast Clintons'rape allegations before the senates'vote onIMPEACHMENT Brokaw. She chewed up Couric and Donahue I wonder if that,s why msnbc FIRED him.National Review lost me when Goldberg dropped her column after 9/11.Hope his wife is doing well in the transportation department,also wonder if a little anti christian bias reared it's head when she heatedly(remember this was right after9/11) wrote we should go over there kill their terrorist leaders and turn them all into christians.I guess her passion was too much I guess she should have been more like the head of Rueters who refused to call those"freedom fighters" terrorists who just killed 3000 people.Later of coursethey decided they probably were terrorists after all.Ifshe ever runs for president she'll not only have my vote I will go all over the country campaigning and spendall my money unless of course she picks senator clinton as her runnng mate.Thats all folks!
APL5JXLY6TWD4	March 10, 2003	5.0	This is a tremendous book for any conservative who is tired of the daily and nightly liberal blatherings of Maureen Dowd, Tom Brokaw, Dan Rather, etc., ad nauseum.
APY48RX36UF1C	February 12, 2003	5.0	It's about time someone came out with a well researched, well foot noted book into the liberal news media, and the outlandish claims made by so many on the left.  I found the book engaging, but at the same time frustrated.  Oh, I was not frustrated with Ann's bold approach to the issues, but with the media, liberals, and many others who attempt to spin actual events to their pleasing.  Thank you Ann for providing a testament of what is really going on in America, it was long overdue.
A19HC2XCBRUZXW	June 27, 2002	5.0	Ann's books is an excellent portrayal of the liberal bias in the American media that is constantly promoting immoral, irresponsible, irrelevant people and ideas that are harmful to the future survival of this nation. Coulter's book can be described as nothing more than brillant and should be in the hands of every journalism student in America, so that they will not fall into the trap of subjective liberal ideology.
A3VXJM65ZM9LIR	November 13, 2002	1.0	I would like to know the same thing - where are the reviews? You can't hide the fact that there are some fascists with opinions out there, we can handle it!
A3VXJM65ZM9LIR	November 13, 2002	1.0	I would like to know the same thing - where are the reviews? You can't hide the fact that there are some fascists with opinions out there, we can handle it!
A11OXO1M97JXG0	September 19, 2002	5.0	I absolutely loved this book.  Ann has a gutsy style that reflects wit, intellect, and most of all integrity!  It is about time a conservative had the backbone to speak with vigor and honesty.  Since the liberal media only presents one side of issues, it is refreshing to see the whole picture.  I have read and reread many parts of this book because I enjoy Ann's clever use of words.
A1KZ5IOZ4NWN3Y	August 18, 2004	5.0	No other book I've read comes close to nailing America's real problem.  Ignore her critics' claims that her ideas are nothing more than spewed vitriol.  Her massive research is evident, & she's cited even the most far out of claims so that even the most skeptic reader can go straight to the source of liberal lunacy.  She reveals a media that does not deliver truth, and which instead pushes forward its own agenda.  This is the book that liberals don't want you to read.  I suggest that you do.
A1Q26TKBR1NU9H	October 31, 2002	1.0	Ann Coulter is a fine, fine, fine woman; however, her writing skills are poor, poor, poor! As a "flaming" Republican I resent her use of sex to sell her book. (This is a typical liberal tactic which I abhor!) It's unfortunate, though she brings up a good issue or two, her desire to be "sexy" muffles any validity she may have had. Too bad.
A26L3QF973DM6O	March 9, 2004	5.0	Day after day of NPR or CNN got you down?  Sick to death of the "But if it saves one persons life" crowd?  Tired of hearing about how good simple American values are just plain out of touch with the "real" world, well then this is the book for you.   If you believe in income redistribution, the nanny state, abortion-on-demand, the Easter Bunny, or the innocence of Bill Clinton chances are you won't like what you read between these covers.  If you believe that Charlton Heston is some sort of demented Nazi, that Ronald Reagan was an amiable dolt, or that Kevin Phillips has the real dope on how the Bush family is plotting to take over the world, you'll probably throw this book accross the room before three pages are out. Coulter combines the grace of ballerina with the all out assault of a seasoned streetfighter to blow away the popular myths purveyed by the left leaning media elites.
A340K4R4IMHCZ8	October 10, 2002	1.0	Ms Coulter is a credit to the conservative right.  Those subscribing to the conservative right must certainly embrace this work and this author.  After all, she employs the same logic as those who fill the ranks of this ideology:  Promote belief over facts and empirical evidence, and engage in non-stop rhetoric so that listening is ultimately impossible.  As a person who leans to the left, I am so very happy that this author is embraced by the right.  I must admit that I read only the first 100 pages of this book--my stomach could not possibly tolerate any more.  I am anxiously awaiting winter to see if I can find an acceptable use for this book--I hope my fireplace can digest the pages better than I could.  Thus, if one has money to "burn" I strongly suggest this book for cold winter nights with the lights out.
A353R28SFCDHZW	October 18, 2002	1.0	...I thought this might be an interesting read. I myself have no use for liberal propagnda we are inundated with on a dailey basis. However, I don't think Ann Coulter should be allowed to own a book much less write one after what I saw pressed betweent the covers of this one. I have never in my life read anything so BOOOOOORING and childish in my life ! Constant name calling and all the footnotes were ridiculous to say the least. When she paraphrased someone,I checked the footnotes in the back and saw the whole statement that person made, and she took it totally out of context ! If you are going to present your case about the drivel the liberal agenda thrusts on us, at leat do a better job of it than name calling and rhetoric...And I am a stauch conservative Republican by the way !!!!..
A3LCK95B0SJO3W	July 10, 2003	5.0	A great book and alot of true facts that the liberals do not want to admit to and all they can do as uusual is cry and call the author names.  It's a shame they can't see the wrongs of there party and own up to it.  It's always somebody else with liberals.
A60D4FWH5A768	October 26, 2002	5.0	Ann Coulter, one of Washington's new breed of conservative women--media-savvy, smart, combative, and HOT!--takes on the media establishment.  I must confess that I've heard the charge that the media suffers from a liberal bias for most of my life, but I have always been skeptical of the charge.  Sure, most journalists--for reasons I don't understand--tend to be Democrats, and occasionally see things through "left"-colored glasses.  I've always just accepted this as the price paid for having real, live human beings covering and reporting the news.  Noone can be entirely free of their own biases, not journalists nor anybody else, no matter hard how they try. But Coulter charges something entirely different.  She believes that among the American media there is an active, abiding, and hostile bias against all things Republican and Conservative.  She flatly proves that the US media is constantly engaged in a never-ending campaign to push liberal causes, ideas and leadership while undermining the Right when and where possible.  While I'll admit that through the first few chapters (rich in examples of liberal media bias, by the way) I remained very skeptical of her claims.  But she keeps it up, page; after page; after page.  She cites numerous example of media mistreatment of Republicans, countered by complimentary or flat-out fawning coverage of Democrats, time and again.  By the end of the book, I came away convinced that America IS subject to an unrelenting media campaign to undermine the conservative and libertarian movements. I challenge any true liberals out there to read this book, the whole thing, and post what you feel.  I give odds that you'll see the media in a new light.
AEUFYQ2BJSF0M	July 7, 2002	5.0	I read her book with a knowing nod....especially when it comes to debating "liberals" on the subject of gun control. I have always called it - "like arguing with a 6 yr old", soon all reason, logic, facts and common sense are thrown out the window and you are left with, "well, no one needs one" and "you must be a gun nut (even though I live in Chicago and don't have one) and think that violence solves everything".....omg
AI1JEPAP2HQVR	September 4, 2003	5.0	This goes well with a healthy dose of Savage, Charen, Hannity, Elder, and Souza---with some Freidman, Hayek, and Von Mises to top it all off. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR??  GET READING, AMERICANS!!!
ANR2IWHBYPAWE	January 9, 2004	5.0	A great read.  It makes me want to befriend all of the ego-fornicating lawyers from Connecticut to Texas. Her insights and wisdom are invaluable for the "eighty percent, or whatever it is" (Chomsky), that are without the wherewithal and gumption to assess for themselves critically, and with a healthy open mind, actual fact verses fiction and understanding the function of persuasive agenda. It says what a so-called "conservative" WANTS to hear, no matter how distorted, or invented, the reality.   All of coulters books, in hard cover if possible, should be a treasured collection for any library, including this book.  Like your bible, this book should be purchased new, and read in a literal sense, (not a liberal one, God no) in that special republican way that will allow translation into your tidy little accommodations.
AO747FR6I9XEK	January 21, 2003	1.0	i feel saddened that people will "denounce slander" by slandering those they disagree with.  Ann Coulter is an extremist annoyed that not everyone shares her views.  She fails to see things objectively and therefore screams into the wind like the people she attacks. Extreme right is as faulty as extreme left in its goal of objectivity. if someone tells you not to trust what you hear.... can you trust the person who told you?
A336HTTMF67RHX	July 4, 2002	3.0	Coultier's book portrays conservatives as, no-nonsense types of politicians, while they too abuse power, as well as add considerable "pork" to the country.  I see them as complete Nazis!  They want nobody to question their authority!  Meanwhile, liberals throw words at conservatives, such as, "Homophobia/homophobic" to put them immediately on the defensive.  Such a word is very powerful and persuasive, but to nip that type of slander in the bud, I would respond with an analysis of the word "homophobia".  It is the fear of gays/gay lifestyle, labeling conservative types with a phobia (or fear) and a pseudo-mental illness!  In the meantime, gay pride parades show the freaks and geeks wearing their fruitcake clothes, leading each other around by dog leashes!!! Hmmm! I tend to be on the conservative side, yet be quite radical.  This is a good book to check out, but please be objective and try to view politics from the author's point of view!
A2FW2Z9KTJC9H1	June 25, 2002	1.0	Ms. Coulter has written a book that rivals the best of Grim when it comes to fairy tales.  I was actually looking for something insightful, something for us conservatives to hang our hats on.  Maybe a mantra.  Instead I got most of the rhetoric I should have expected...
A1ODSH8MFW25TB	June 28, 2002	4.0	Lefties being bashed, and they don't like it one bit. This book certainly isn't a political work to be read 5 years from now, but for today, how nice to see someone playing the game at which liberals are so adept :  attack.  This book makes evident that in modern so-called Liberal Thought are the seeds of a new fascism. A subtle fascism, to be sure, but nonetheless dangerous at that.
AU9PIU55L3HJR	November 12, 2003	1.0	my god, what have we done to deserve this drivel. It might fly in the US but the rest of the civilised world is gobsmacked. It is the right wing raving's of Coulter, O'reilly & co that push the line AMERIKA forever right or wrong that really alienate the rest of the planet from the 5th Riech.
A2X8ZJET4AE81F	August 2, 2003	1.0	Ann Coulter knows that the conservative right is dominant in this country, but in order to gain readers she needs to create an imaginary source of outrage. Watch a couple hours of those cable news channels, and see how "liberal" they truly are.
AXE0WNDVXSP6R	July 4, 2002	1.0	I have no doubt that Ann Coulter hates the left.  This isn't much a of a substantial argument against it.  She makes some of the strangest claims; comparing, for example, Katie Couric with Eva Braun....
A18IFI8UXDN51B	July 1, 2003	5.0	Coulter expands the work Bernard Goldberg began with Bias into relevant conjecture about true statistics. While many of her challenges are bold, she does make a few concessions promoting a much more balanced argument than Goldberg made. Outrageous attacks against this book are most likely attacks based on partisanship rather than collected, rational reasoning. (See Ch. 8: Clever is As Clever Does) While portions can be rather dry, Coulter's wit abounds in the second half with biting sarcasm that is periodically laugh out loud funny.
A1C4U6LP580RGM	December 13, 2002	5.0	I loved this book!  Ann Coulter hits the nail on the head in this dead-on compilation of liberal bias in the media. The author is smart and funny and the book is fascinating. Read it and your eyes will be opened!
A1E7V6XI4LNP8I	December 27, 2002	5.0	Ann Coulter delivers one of the most powerful and explosive exposes on the Left's conscious, methodical assault on truth. If you're a conservative, you'll be amazed and outraged at the liberal bias against anything that's even remotely conservative. If you're liberal, hang your head in shame.
A1HZK28789YI5M	June 29, 2003	5.0	It is amazing in these times to find someone who isn't afraid to be politically incorrect and very correct on the subject. In Slander, Coulter shows in detail how the media have distorted facts to fit their liberal agenda. For some, the book is/will be too direct and cutting to the quick. I, however, appreciate the truth in a hard-hitting, right-in-my-face fashion. If you want to tip-toe through the tulips on the truth, then you won't want to read this book. I like Coulter's wit and sarcasm especially when she is exposing the truth, real and uncovered by liberal slant and hatred. It is a joy to read but also very disturbing to see how the masses are deceived daily by newspapers, columnists, and newschannels with an obvious goal towards that end.
A1P358ORN1GXR1	November 28, 2002	5.0	This book makes liberals mad.  Why?  Because it is TRUE!  Dennis Goza wrote a rather aweful book review and he stands guilty of the very thing that Ann Coulter accuses Liberals of doing.  When a liberal is cornered in a debate and the liberal cannot obviously engage him or herself with rational, logical, facts all they can do is use personal attacks and sarcasm but say nothing to literally counter the claims!  Thanks Dennis Goza, your review of the book will surely help to sell more copies!  I suppose these same liberals who hate this book actually are ignorant enough to believe Al Gore's statements on the "Conservative Media Machine"!  How insane!  One has to be blind AND deaf in order to not see the fact that the mainstream media is saturated with liberals!!!
A24Q23TAMT9I6Q	July 20, 2002	5.0	A great expos on the far-reaching infiltration of liberal bias in today's media. Ann pulls no punches in this tell-all work, (which I'm convinced many liberals know all too well is true, but can't admit). All the entries (as far as I could tell) were based on documented fact, and support many of the same "dirty little secrets" that Bernard Goldberg first revealed in his book, "Bias", about the severe left-slanted spin prevalent in today's major news and entertainment media. She also comments on the Fox News Channel, and why American viewers are abandoning the traditional news venues like CNN and ABC in droves, in search of more accurate, truthful reporting. The public is tired of being spoonfed liberal tripe (like when the millennium "supposedly" began), and are more and more in search of factual data, sans the tiresome spin and hype that the left is infamous for dispensing. If you are one of those people, you need to get this book!  First rate work by the sexiest conservative on the planet. *****'s Ann!
A2B7671TWNOJ7A	December 25, 2002	5.0	It was with great joy that I read Slander. Ann Coulter has nicely shown how the left wing media distorts and slants stories making a mockery of their profession and personal integrity. The left wing media slanting and stress on so called Republican gaffs while not giving the same visibility to leftist miscues is very obvious. Her writings reflects what I always suspected but not having Ann Coulters command of the English language could never express myself in her terms. Ann Coulter has made me a believer. I am  a very pro Ann Coulter fan!
A2DG01OY8EZ31O	November 25, 2002	5.0	A rare voice of sanity, will be viewed as a major assault on the liberal megacomplex.  Highly reccomended to conservatives, moderates, or liberals who think they know anything.
A2GU67SK2V60W3	February 13, 2003	5.0	...Just read the one star reviews below. Rather than engage in a reasonable point-counterpoint review, the disagreeing reviewer simply has to make commentary as to Ms. Coulter's sexual needs. That makes sense, not to me, but I'm sure to some lefties it does.  Unbelievable. Just smile knowingly, and be confident in the fact that you are right and the silent majority agrees with you. Read this book, you will enjoy it. Even more when you see a shreiking liberal talking head on TV.
A2PN7UKAV4MZD	September 25, 2002	5.0	This book is even better than Ms. Coulter's newspaper articles (if possible), because she has more time to document and develop her postulations. Her humor is always delightful. Mainstream news people could benefit from this insight. They often ask why the public views them as liberal. Most of her information comes as no suprise to conservatives, but it is gratifying to see it documented in one volume. Conservatives are well represented by Ann Coulter.
A2TP3S88BR9U79	February 2, 2003	5.0	OK, so I thought I was smart. I guess I am not, at least compared to this well written, focused, insightful book on the truths of the American Liberal Movement. She tells it like it is, and this comes from a former teenage-liberal. Yes, I watched Slick Willy talk about boxers over briefs on MTV. I have seen the light, and the great conservatives of our time has shown me how.
A31KL64MZI3BON	July 17, 2003	5.0	Now we know that the media really is biased. Now, the media actually isn't going to say that its liberal, so we muist expose them. You can't tell me that Dan Rather and Tom Brockaw aren't biased liberals. The only thing conservatives have is Fox News, the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal, Human Events, and National Review (I'll bet you you've never heard anything good about the latter two in the newspapers). A great read.
A3E9LEB7R2TRQY	April 26, 2003	5.0	It is indeed a very ad hominem book, and one very vicious to liberals, and I imagine it must give a foreigner a very jaded view of American Politics, but it's the truth.  I've debated American leftists myself, and I can tell you they did exaclty what Ms. Coulter said they do: call names and quote other liberals.  They said my "language" was "dangerous", and one of them referred me to Edward Hermann, Greg Palast, and Noam Chomsky in one paragraph.    A lot of it amused me, but none of it shocked me, as most of what she said was stuff I could identify with.  She says in I think her first chapter that conservatives call names too, but conservatives are reserved and choosy in their name-calling.  We like to have our name-calling impart our genuine opinion of someone, rather than merely state "I hate you".  She mentions this in her book as well - the fact that the majority of liberal name-calling "conveys nothing other than 'I hate you'" or "good dog" and "bad dog".     This is a trend which has been going on for a while, and I'm glad someone stood up and put it all in perspective.  I can only hope that in the future, or at least the near future, liberals will feel ashamed to randomly call their opponents "Nazi", "fascist", "racist", etc, remembering how stupid it gets to sound after a while.
AC77OSEIS7OKF	July 16, 2003	5.0	...how we've been lied to in the media, in our schools, & by the Democrats, for the past 30 years.  I was raised on the left coast in the 60's, and feel like I've just had the blinders lifted!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
ACWQSWASBWIY9	August 6, 2002	5.0	You will never watch the news or listen to the radio the same way again.  It makes one realize how manipulative the liberals are in todays society.
APTU6X9RE34U4	September 22, 2003	5.0	This is an excellent book but be prepared to have your dictionary at the ready if your vocabulary is slightly lacking.  Very well researched and extremely imformative.  A must read.
A1U38VF9WZEHL9	October 19, 2003	3.0	Liberals, stop obsessing over her just because she has nice legs and because she has more guts than the entire Democratic party. that's pretty much a direct quote from a liberal, MICHAEL MOORE. just thought i'd say that. and i think i'll read this even thoguh I lean to the left.
A2WPS9TTX6LLJJ	June 20, 2003	2.0	It was definatly an entertaining read.  She is obviosuly very passionate, but does tend to profess a lot of hate speech.  If she would tone done the rhetoric and hire a couple of more fact-checkers, I would have been able to take the book a little more seriously.
ARZJF7Z5VY3RC	June 30, 2002	3.0	Human beings are constantly seeking to "be right", to be in control, to be a member of the correct party. As long as that remains the goal the delusion persists. Like young children still frightened by ghosts in the closet we adults habitually label this group or that group to be the demons we thought we had outgrown. This delusion is not particular to any political party. It is part of all of us until we see through it. And then the cycle starts again. If someone were to simply look at information for informations sake there are realities to be seen. Sometimes these realities are found in views supported by the Democrats and sometimes by the Republicans. It is the information that needs examination, free from the delusion of the ghosts from our pasts - if we dare get out of bed and take a peek. The Rain forest are being damaged and they cannot recover - not for a thousand years or more - that is a "fact" that history supports when we examine where forrests once stood. Socialized healthcare for all supports a "co-dependant" society that is still searching for mommy and daddy in government - there is no solution there. Adults will be children until their not.
A3558VEEY06J79	January 26, 2003	1.0	What prompts someone to make such blanket statements on subjects she obviously knows little about? Should be listed under "fiction".
AAT71ERZCHHOU	July 3, 2002	2.0	Is this the pot calling the kettle black, or what?
AZJCHPKWIR5UA	June 25, 2003	1.0	the ONE thing Coulter did in her life which deserves praise, it the one thing ignored in these reviews by conservatives.  She WAS THE ONE WHO GOT "Stupid White Men" published!!!  She made the call to the publisher to help Moore get the book to print.  Moore's book IS researched and cited from cover to cover.  Sadly, Ms. Coulter does not take the time to do the same, and her "facts" are more tilted that a windmill in Don Quixiote.  Her prose reads more like bitter angry prose than a hard core examination of truth.
A13CUEDGAT1LV4	June 26, 2003	5.0	Liberals Just can't handle the truth! Slander is right on the mark. Facts facts facts plain simple truthful, no bull recommended read for any College Kid. you go Ann!
A1EUL3BF8I51ZW	October 15, 2003	5.0	One of the most compelling, well documented pieces of work that depicts the true danger of liberal thinking.  Reveals their elitist, hegemonic personas. Liberal bigotry subsists on the oxygen of sanctimony. They are true socialists who want to derive their power from our tax money.
A253DPVD078B9S	May 13, 2003	5.0	and that is exactly why I love it!  Coulter's fearless writing is refreshing amidst the "politically correct" bull that is drowning our society.  She shouldn't be taken offensively, but undoubtedly, people with label her racist and other such nonsense.  Liberals don't like her because she uncovers their lies.  They use the same quote to describe her every time.  She is a supposed "right wing tele-bimbo."  The fact that she has blonde hair makes her stupid, I guess.  It is hilarious because liberals prove her point when they twist her quotes to make her out to be something she isn't.  When you are as brazen as her it's easy to do.  She must be admired.
AMTK5LGKYBL61	June 3, 2004	5.0	Ironic how most of the libs that review this book and give it one star, say things like, "I didn't read much of it..."  That's because they had to have a dictionary close by to understand any of the words longer than six letters.  It's also funny that those that give a one star rating tell you to read Al Frankens book. You think there is a political agenda there?  Al Franken is one of the most ignorant, vile men I can think of.  The truth of the matter is that this book is filled with footnotes citing every reference that Ann used to write the book.  If the libs don't like the facts then they shouldn't blame it on Ann.  Liberals hate facts anyway so taking it out on Ann probaby is a catharsis for them. This book is fantastic and eye-opening.  If you are a liberal you'll hate what it contains and by extension, probably hate Ann Coulter.  But if you can read it with an open mind you'll find it frightening what the liberals and the liberal media is up to.  Trust me, this is a fantasitc book.
A36YZ5S09QAMRK	December 28, 2002	5.0	Not only did I have trouble putting this down, I developed a huge crush on Ms. Coulter, because she is so dead on with everything. As a young conservative, I feel that what Ann writes and says is perfect. She disses those low-lifes like Slick Willy (Bill Clinton) and Al Sharpton. Buy this book, and you will be so pleased. If you are a liberal, this book may change your political ideals!
A1P2AFHY4VFG0Z	July 9, 2002	3.0	... I read it and agree with a good deal of it but I don't think it's the best book ever written. It's great that  everything is documented with footnotes, but it makes her sarcastic tone seem out of place. Even if you don't mind it in small doses, it gets anoying after 200 pages.  It would have been better if she just stuck to the subject of the liberal media and not slipped into criticizing liberals in general. You can say conservatives are in general more polite than liberals (true) or you can ridicule liberals, but doing both in the same book is a little odd. Although she sometimes overstates her case, she has some great --  and witty -- observations you won't find anywhere else. And with her handy dandy LexisNexis  search engine, she shows no mercy as she exposes one hypocrisy in the media after another. Read it with an open mind and don't be afraid to challenge your beliefs....
AL8HCH9DXTI3Q	January 23, 2003	4.0	I'm not sure "A Reader" from Coralville, IA and "Fred Smithington" from Too Bad, USA read the same book being reviewed here. While I partially agree with some reviewers who claim that the book is not exceptionally written, I cannot fathom how one would claim the book is poorly researched. For each example provided by Ms. Coulter there is a footnote with the actual newspaper article or TV program from which the quote is pulled. Indeed, each chapter contains nearly 100 footnotes containing a detailed reference. IOW, the evidence presented could not have been more thoroughly documented and supported. The chapter outlining the liberal's righteous indignation over the media's occasional hiring of a Republican (i.e., Susan Molanari) is a hilarious account of arrogance and hypocrisy. That chapter alone is worth the price of the book. Ms. Coulter's sarcastic writing style can be very biting, so I understand how those whose oxen are being gored will not take kindly to this book. But if you truly want to see how the media uses its bias against the right, and can get beyond her caustic writing style and frequent generalizations, just read the book for the sheer volume of supporting documentation. (Which is nothing more than the media's own words.) Unless your mind is already made up that there is no such thing as media bias, this book is very much worth reading. It will give anyone with an open mind some insight as to how the media stacks the deck against the right. That's not a complaint; it's just honest recognition of how things are.
A27AUK4UJM51Q3	July 11, 2002	5.0	I enjoy watching the Liberals/Democrats spewing hate and claiming that she lied. 1/4th of the book is documentation and while the liberals claim Coulter spews hate, the liberals prove they spew hate in their reviews for a book it's clear they never read. Liberal hypocrisy at it finest..Too bad it's so common
A33SK0ALQ6QM1Q	July 1, 2002	2.0	...   The book is replete with irony, not the least of which, for a woman who  would like to see the nation's women totally lose their voice (she is  actually on record as advocating a repeal of suffrage(!) because she thinks  women voters support too many taxing social programs), Coulter herself has  quite a bit to say.  Most of it is merely repetitive abuse and at least as  slanderous as that which she is castigating, but nonetheless entertaining.         Inaccurate, out of context quoting is a motif of the book.  She starts  immediately with the charge that the "leftwing media" (where is this leftwing  media she seems to find everywhere?  I would love to watch something left of  center in the mainstream media, if I could find it!) has labeled Rep. Tom  DeLay (R.-Texas) "the Hammer" and "the Exterminator".  He does indeed have  these nicknames, but what many readers will not know is, he proudly adopted  them HIMSELF.  I guess they feed his macho pride.  And he literally WAS an  exterminator before he came to Congress, which is how that one got started.   When he was minority "whip" he kept a large leather whip in his office and  brandished it liberally (pardon the expression) at visitors.  The guy is  nothing if not literal-minded.    There are many other examples of this kind of twist; the "lawn jockey"  charge against the NY Times is another--that's the one where she cleverly  quotes a critical editorial headline from the Times and combines it with  out-of-context pejoratives aimed at Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas  from other sources--so the reader gets the (mistaken) impression that the  Times called Thomas a "lawn jockey".  It would be quite a research project to  parse every one of her quotes and separate the wheat from the chaff, and  Coulter knows most folks don't have that kind of time--so her inaccuracies,  sadly, will probably stand.    Life is definitely a comedy to those who think.  Another amusing irony in  the book is her hoisting of the Paula Jones banner.  I guess we feminists  should really thank  Jones for turning every conservative Christian in the  country into a virulent feminist, frothing over the scourge of sexual  harrassment.  Oh but I forgot--sexual harrassment is an outrage only when  it's committed by Democrats.  Conveniently omitted from the book is the fact  that Coulter's very own marbled icon, Phyllis Schlafly, to whom she refers  often in wide-eyed adoration, has ridiculed the entire concept of sexual  harrassment and once stated primly, "Men don't make passes at virtuous  women."  Before Clinton, most Republicans wouldn't even acknowledge that such  a thing as sexual harrassment even existed.    It's wonderful how the law-and-order thumpers of the far right can always  generously excuse their own wrongdoers.  In her torrents of sympathy for the  inferiority complexes of Jones and fellow rightwing pawn Linda Tripp for how  they were "driven" to numerous plastic surgeries to satisfy the whims of the  sadistic media (!), Coulter doesn't mention how they amassed all the bucks  for these operations: mostly, by hitting up their conservative database for  donations towards "legal expenses."  Last time I checked, a nose job,  facelift and liposuction were not exactly "legal expenses".  So does  law-and-order Annie think that Jones and Tripp should be prosecuted for  embezzlement and raising money under false pretenses (felonies)?  Don't be  silly---prosecution of criminal behavior is only for Democrats.    I could go on, but on cursory examination those were the salient points I  noticed.  Here's hoping some of her "facts" will be more accurately  deconstructed.
A3QK475IU86913	November 12, 2005	1.0	The Book Slander, by ann Coulter is similar to reading the exact opposite of what MARCEL PROUST would write.. Her father was a African Tunisian Muslim, and this is a very well CONCEALED FACT, as he gave up the paternal rights to ann at the age of 3. She has inbred agression towards the darker races and non chrisitian religions due to her personal tragedies.   Never the less, the book is really a true wonder, of what god is capable of creating. Her vivasection of the truth, is so preposterous, that it makes on gasp.   He book is just her opinion, nothing factual is written or published in " Slander ", it should have been called, Slander- A novel, its a pure fiction book, and i think it should be actually be nominated for the Booker Prize for fiction in the genre of creative realism.   Dont buy the book, just go to the library, borrow it, read the first ten pages, and  you will understand what I am talking about.   - Anastasia Troy
A14XULA608M2V8	October 22, 2002	1.0	Coulter commits every one of the "crimes" she blames on liberals. This book is a rant about people who rant. She starts out sounding like she will present actual facts, and she does have a few sprinkled throughout the book, but in the end she resorts to name-calling, baiting, and gleeful dancing on graves. There are a few valid points, some are even made without too much invective, but she commits every one of the sins of stereotyping she so decries. Phrases like "every liberal" and "all democrats" are everywhere.  This would have made a good pamphlet.
A1RA2U4UZF0G3L	July 15, 2002	5.0	Those of you who rated this book with one star and ranted against it -- you are the ones who are biased. This books provides clear and irrefutable arguments. I saw one review that shocked me so much, I had to laugh! The reviewer said that the media is CONSERVATIVE! Wow, I guess that review must be a radical socialist who voted for Ralph Nader! The bottom line is that the media is so tilted to the left that any reasonable person is forced to listed to so-called "conservative" talk radio. Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage, and others are the only clear, reasonable voices out there. Hatred? The hatred is coming from the Left, not the right. The Left hates traditional families, men, and children. The Left represents self-obsessed radical feminists, militant gays, and anti-American nuts. Reasonable Americans of all races, religions, and gender orientation realize that the Republican party is the closest thing we have these days to the American ideal that our ancestors fought for!
A216Q2XBUIQSS8	November 15, 2005	1.0	Just plain non-sense. I've actually randomly checked her facts and never found anything that made me think she had a point.
A2B58YQFYTX5E4	January 25, 2003	5.0	This was my first political book, and baby the truth will set you free! So nice to actually get the WHOLE story and not the editorials that pass for news. Read one review from "pink slippers" that said "where did she get her facts?" well pinky maybe look in the back of the book. From page 206 to 241 is all the well documented places she got her facts. All the news papers etc. SHe lists where all the gargage came from and then PROVES them wrong.I'm about to read it for the second time. Every right leaning and open minded liberal should read this book. It will make the right more proud and will make the left realize how duped they've been. Facts and facts and this is the best book ever!!
A2IR6ABERAWNWO	February 23, 2003	5.0	Not only is she a hottie, she is extremely funny too.  I used to be a liberal (I am recovering quickly).  I know how mad I used to get when conservatives would hit me with facts and I got all flustered because I didn't have any facts to hit them back with. So when I got on the internet to find some facts to counter their arguments with,  I slowly started realizing that maybe the conservatives aren't so evil after all. Socially , I am very liberal , but when it comes to defense, tax policy, schools, patriotism, I am as far right as you can go bro . Peace out.
A2LB7OXXNGOGJY	April 27, 2003	5.0	Though this excellent tome is easily found in good, conservative book stores everywhere (at a substantial discount), I vehemently recommend paying full price for the hard cover edition!!! It is treasure that your children - and your children's children - will savor in the years to come. I found it a bit heavy on the postmodern symbolism - a flaw I attribute to the notorious Liberal Arts Mafia that has plagued our once distinguished education system for lo these many years - but, nonetheless, a scathing indictment of the circular logic, pomposity and sneering condescension so typical of "liberals". The fully supported allegations speak volumes about the disturbing national trend towards moral relativism. Just read a few chapters and it will become clear; "liberals" have undermined all that is good and pure in America. Right thinking Americans need to know about the pernicious influences poisoning civilized discourse. Does Ann resort to hyperbole while gigging the "liberal" frog? Yes! But a shock to the system becomes necessary when one is contending against the dark forces that threaten to consume what's left of our once wholesome traditions. One naturally hesitates to modify what is destined to become a classic, but a more appropriate title would be "Lancing the Festering Boil, Pustulence and Depravity in the Liberal Mindset".
A2N5FHINLBTYE6	January 12, 2004	4.0	Coulter displays her brilliant mind in this piece of art that defies the politically correct and berates the media elites and [cuts] the liberal point of view.  Leaves the left wing with their mouths open with nothing to do but name-call a little bit more.  With a foreword by Rush Limbaugh that does nothing but increase the intellectual value of this masterpiece, everyone should enjoy the proven facts and strong opinions in Slander.
A2S2WP83LKCGL9	July 9, 2002	2.0	...The hypocrisy will flow from the pages and penetrate to the bone. Ann (yes, the same Ann who has said women should have their voting rights stripped away due to lack of logical, non-emotional reasoning) cleverly disguises herself as a argument analyst by using Plexiglas-clear attacks on leftist/liberals/Democrats, as from her view they are apparently one in the same. The attacks are clear and use the same judgmental, over-emotional babble that is spewed by extremist on both sides of the spectrum. Perhaps a laugh is just as good as a mental blanket that will shield logical reasoning from the red-herrings and falsities? This could have been a good book if the arguments made were to be used as blanket arguments against those extremist who argue on both the liberal and conservative fronts, but instead this book catapults Ann to the top of the conservative ranks and allows her to become nothing more than a cheerleader who pledges blind allegiance to the conservative right...
A2VRC58BHOBZ1A	November 6, 2002	1.0	...first they had the nerve to drag us out of the Great Depression.  Then they pulled us through WWII and out of Viet Nam.  That perverted SOB Clinton cleaned up the economic mess that Reagan and Bush I left behind just in time for Bush II to do it all over again...and we're so glad W ignored all those damn chickens that squawked about the sky falling before 9/11/01. I can seriously say that I find the scholarly works of Lee and Kirby, circa 1965, far more believable than the anecdotal ramblings of Ms. Coulter.  What a long way we have come since then, when people like her would have been routinely committed to the nearest psychiatric facility!
A3NEEB3FDLEB83	February 18, 2004	5.0	Listen, the Liberal, socialistic LEFT has been unAmerican all of my lifetime and it is about time someone has the courage to shove all their circular arguments back in their faces. Suprisingly, it is an attractive blonde who all happens to be one of the brightest, shapest minds of our day! Ann is not afraid to tell it like it is and she pulls no punches! I've seen her in public and she politely waved wildly, making me feel even more a connection with her. Her web site is great and this book is FABULOUS. A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL TO MIDDLE AGE!
A3OC4XKQKGJNJI	December 2, 2004	5.0	Ms.Coulter makes a lot of valid points in this book.  The bilbliography in the back is helpful and her use of modern researching techniques is a great pointer to those of us in the general public who would like to know more about our news, such as where it comes from, why it's left out, or why it's included in the mainstream media.  I like that she's a historian of sorts, that she has researched public officals of the past, and that she includes the media representation of them.  She not only introduced very useful research engines in this book, but also a few wonderfully heroic persons that I've never heard of, which is why I give the book five stars.  The book is not a perfectly objective, nonemotional presentation of media bias, but then, neither is this book review.  I am overwhelmingly in favor of a book that imparts knowledge of heroic figures deserving of recognition, factual bibliographies, and guidance in research.
A3RN9GA67BZ43A	June 29, 2002	3.0	While Ms. Coulter is great at debating, etc., I find some of her statements and worldview just a little disconcerting.  If one looks past the confidant(at times, arrogant) style in her reasoning, past the attractive and witty blonde that she is, some of her dogma reminds me (you history buffs should know) of some passionate, but scary characters of the past. While I can't go into it here, I also found some of her footnotes and sources misleading and inaccurate after checking a couple out. She's passionate, intelligent, and charasmatic and the Christian Right loves her.  She could be dead wrong in her accusations, however. I didn't find her to be that Christ-like, either.   Got the impression that like many extremists on both sides, there is a lot of propagandizing in order to sell copy and help get votes.  This is one of those books. . .
A3RW2BMZ3M67O9	June 1, 2003	1.0	Despite her obvious disapproval of the liberal "slander" of the right wing, she does nothing but slander liberals.  She gives conservatives a bad name.  How about a well balanced view of the media.  Besides, conservatives are in control of the media, just look at the bull that FOX NEWS pumps out.
A47OET91ZVI9J	July 16, 2002	4.0	It's so good people *DON'T* want you to read it!  This is a combination of devastating fact and unashamed style. The personal attacks on the author are proof that this book is not only stylish and powerful, but that it's also right on the mark when it talks about the cheap shots and cheaper tricks the liberal-dominated media have used as their stock in trade for decades, now.  Each time liberals slam Coulter it's like an endorsement for open-minded people to grab this book and read it.  One has to ask.  What's in this book that democrats and other liberals DON'T want YOU to see?  it's well worth finding out.   This is a book each and every American should read, precisely because the left doesn't want them to read it.  The truth hurts and while this work delivers pain to the left-leaning media big-bugs it helps us all to further realize the enormity of the problem that occurs when *any* single political party's faithful have a strangle hold on a vast majority of a people's sources of information.
A7QP2H2WYQW4P	February 4, 2003	1.0	This book is exactly what it hates. It doesn't take a smart person to realize that Coulter sold lots of books and created much controversy about her "book" by taking it to the "liberal media." She should thank the liberal media everyday for buying her car, house and designer clothes through elevated book sales. Without the liberal media she would be just another scared reactionary living in Montana, writing manifestos and blowing up Planned Parenthoods. Geez, come on. This book is a waste of time. I urge people to ignore the liberal media and dig beyond the best seller lists to find true political commentary. This "book" is a standup routine written down. The bad part is that it isn't funny.
AFCPD5ZZG3GCI	July 16, 2002	5.0	This book is awesome!  Read it in one night.  It really made me think and understand the liberal bias in this country.  Everyone should read this book twice.
AFR9V3EXQVFG4	July 16, 2002	5.0	This book is exactly what fans of Ann Coulter, and conservatives in general, have come to expect from our diva on the right.  Liberals, based on some of the other reviews I read, have either bought it, or more likely read the book jacket, and then came up with some insightful commentary like "IT'S TRASH!"  Ann does a thorough job of discussing an obvious attempt by the left to methodically destroy anyone who disagrees with their thoughts and ideas.  In example after example, she meticulously documents examples of the liberal media's attempt to twist and pervert conservative's ideas, and demonize those who express them.  The chapter on Al "Inventer of the Internet" Gore is especially entertaining.  If you enjoy Ann's insightful commentary, or are a liberal desperately in need of deprogramming, buy this book.
AKFBWPUQB7ZD2	February 21, 2003	5.0	Ann Coulter's Slander is an intriguing book.  I was at first turned off by the first couple of chapters, because it seemed as though her diatrabe was nothing more than what liberals do.  However, as I read through I began to better understand her style.  This is a great book out there for anyone who doesn't believe there is a liberal slant to the news.  Of course I doubt that they'd read it.  As Ann says, Liberals don't debate the actual issues, they just call you stupid and move on.
AR4NZWNJ3CLAN	July 7, 2002	1.0	The game of personal destrction never ends. This is a dusturbing book by the female version of Rush Limbaugh or Bill O'Reilly. The antics of Ann Coulter have been told in David Brocks outstanding book. Save the money for the book and political thought by following the money in the right wing world. As John Mellencamp said of Ronald Reagan'"He ain't gonna help no poor men, he ain't gonna help no children. Thank God he went back to California". Ann and her cronies fit those lines to perfection, and hopefully the game of personal destruction will end soon.
A32ZVXEV2G9WL7	July 8, 2002	3.0	First, I agree with her thesis, but I don't think there is enough here to support a whole book.  The first chapter is a brilliant essay on the subject, and it may be worth the price of the book to read it.  Most of the rest seems redundant.  She does provide a lot of footnotes and references, which indicates that she is at least trying to back up her positions with sources one can check into.  I doubt that most of her opponents will bother, but at least the information is there.    Now, let's review the reviewers... the most fascinating thing I find is that most of the unfriendly reviewers I have read or seen on TV do exactly what she accuses liberals of doing, e.g. call names, comment on her appearance, cite Diane Sawyer as an example of a supposed Republican who is now in the major media, etc., and they fail to see the irony of this.  I think that this predictive value (if you will) of her writing supports her thesis as well or better than the references.
A395X20MDA235R	December 28, 2002	1.0	This book is exactly what one of the previous reviewers wrote, "a whiney rant." Her proofs and footnotes do not checkout, and her quotes are completely paraphrased and inaccurate. But, I do recommend it if you just want to feed your preconceived notions and dislikes of anyone left of the extreme right. In conclusion, I would just like to say that I used to be a Republican.
A3EKLHJ0TJUKK0	February 6, 2003	1.0	This book is a blatent display of ignorance. It lacks depth and credibility.  Ann needs to do some research and read a few history books. Its easy to blame problems on people who have different opinions than you, rather than putting together a valid argument to support your own ideas and opinions.  Thumbs down, Ann.
A3FT66J2IGDYIC	September 24, 2002	1.0	I was worried that I would  be alone in my disgust for this book, but I can see that other people recognise it for the trash it is. Ann Coulter tries to make a case that liberal extremeist are dangerous. However, she seems to ignore the fact that extreme conserveratives such as herself are just as bad. Her book is filled with hyperbolic statements, exaggeration, and mendacious nonsense. She can't make an argument for her ideas without prefacing the comment with some snide insult or vitrolic assult on liberalism. In fact, Ms. Coulter scatters these insults throughout the book as if they add some sort of credence to her ravings. I just can't see how the country is served by the egregious blather of a conservative extremeist. Ms Coulter makes statements about how the media is full of liberal bias, but doesn't say why it wasn't present when President Clinton was dissected, examined, and villified in the press during the Monica debacle. This book is filled with the same kind of dangerous propaganda that it pretends to expose. The only good thing about it is that it shows how ugly most extremeism can be, no matter where it comes from.
A3IRUMIOXLBVFF	December 26, 2002	1.0	I don't know where to begin, really. Coulter seems to think by footnoting quotes from "liberals" she establishes some legitimacy for this appalling screed. It would be funny if it wasn't so sad, since some people actually eat this stuff up and put some stock in it. Unfortunately, a lot of political discussion in this country has been reduced to Coulter's level, due to the simple-minded dumbing down of the discussion by the likes of Limbaugh, the Fox News Channel, and other empty talking heads. Read only if you have a strong stomach, or if you are a dittohead and need more propping up of your bankrupt belief system.
A14CTDKYPF7QH6	January 27, 2003	1.0	I could gain more useful information by hanging a magnet from a string and asking it questions. At least it will keep me warm this winter.
A15SCDT7Y7FDVQ	February 10, 2003	1.0	Coulter's "Slander" proves one thing:  Americans will buy just about anything.  Coulter "ditto heads" aren't just buying the book though, they're also buying into the spew contained within! Any person with a scintilla of intelligence will reject Coulter's nonsense for what it is:  a transparent attempt to SLANDER those with a different viewpoint as something slightly less evil than Satan.   Maybe someone should tell the pot (Coulter) she is every bit as 'black' as the kettle she accuses.  Maybe someone should give her a mirror?
A16G69DF79FTQY	July 7, 2002	5.0	I just finshed reading Ann's book Slander and it was a fun read to say the least!!!   I recommend it to all who are into the news and want to see how, over these many years, the mass media has slowly been working on putting out nothing more than liberal propaganda. No one on the left can deny that what Ann says in her book did not happen.  She has pages upon pages of footnotes to back up her statements.   It would be fun to get a room full of libs together and toss this book out on the table and step back to watch the hissy fit it will cause!!!  Oh it must hurt so for the libs to have their own tactics and behavour reflected back at them by this book!!  As witnessed by some of the reviews on this site, it is apparent that the proposition of Ann's book of libs not being able to get passed much more than name calling is obvious. Go buy this book if you are at all interested in the liberal slant found in the press.  Then sit back and watch the libs get their panties in a twist!!!!  The next couple of weeks are going to be interesting to say the least!!!
A18KN4C5BQVKKU	July 5, 2002	5.0	Ann Coulter has outdone herself this time with her masterful handling of the subject of Liberal Lies.The book shows what is going on behind the scenes in the Liberal mind and even more importantly exposes the lies we have been fed by the media for the last few decades and how they actually manipulate what is going on in Washington to suit their purposes.Surely this book will enflame liberal readers to strike out at her,for she has uncovered what they have been hiding from the public for so long.  An honest observer of what was written has to admit that she has spoken the truth, for the claims are backed up with proof of their validity by numerous footnotes.I would recommend this book for every citizen in the U.S. for it will help them sort out the trash we have been raised on from the Liberal media and make us more informed to make the best decision while in the voting booth.
A1C24DQTQA0KD0	June 28, 2002	5.0	With 35 pages of footnotes... I didn't expect to be laughing out loud on every other page... Great Book.
A1G55UB8KOVNV9	July 3, 2002	5.0	I enjoyed it very much.  I think she could make another book from the rabid negative reviews from leftist that won't or can't read the book.  I also love the " so-called" conservatives that are also trying to savage the book.  Remember the left tries to destroy by "any means necessary" including lying by pretending to be someone they are not.  Two best sellers now!  Great job Ann!
A1U90L654BOXAW	July 8, 2002	5.0	Finally, someone has taken the time to meticulously document the myriad of lies and accusations that the left has been waging against the American right for decades. Slander not only debunks the many myths that the liberal media have created about conservatives (ie. how does one become a member of the non-existant religious right?) but it also delves deep into the liberal psyche to expose the true cause of their malicious ways...HATE. Liberals hate conservatives and their ideas and the only way to keep them quiet is to systematically discredit their every thought and idea by repeating mind numbing propaganda so that the average American doesn't have a choice but to eventually accept what their being told...in their predictable 3rd grade liberal mentality...Liberals are good, Conservatives are bad (and of course my daddy can beat up your daddy, too.) Coulter has exposed liberals for what they are (idealess, hate filled, quasi-communists) with air tight research and documentation that could easily rival the Starr report in its depth and accuracy. I highly recommend Slander to anyone who wants to know the truth about the American left and how it is trying to sabotage the American way via Orwellian tactics. Ann is my hero!
A1WGWRKYIHT1GZ	August 23, 2003	1.0	This book is riddled with inaccuracies, faulty logic and poorly researched "facts".  For instance, she claims that "Newsweek" magazine's Washington bureau chief Evan Thomas "is the son of Norman Thomas, a four-time Socialist candidate for president.  Had the author done a reasonable amount of research she would have discovered that Norman Thomas actually ran six times.  Not to mention the fact that he is NOT the father of Evan Thomas.  This book, like her other works are brimming with this kind of crud punctuated by her characteristic vitriol.  It represents the worst kind of journalism and ranks right up there with various books concerning UFO's, Bigfoot, and the Loch Ness Monster (i.e., bunk from cover to cover), but without the entertainment value.  Save your money.
A28CF8KDFMD7JA	June 30, 2002	1.0	I read this so-called heavily researched book, and got a lot of great belly laughs at just how poorly written and researched it really is. Coulter says the fact that "far right wing'' came up about 10 times more than "far left wing'' in the NY Times Nexus search "proves'' that it is slanted to the left. Well, guess what? The Washington Times - a paper renowned for its right wing slant - had the same percentage on the same Nexus search. But, of course, Coulter didn't put that in her "book.'' Coulter said liberals only give us invective instead of argument, but calls Katie Couric the "likable Eva Braun of morning TV.'' Yeah, no invective there. If you want a truly good read that exposes (fakes)like Coulter, read David Brock's "Blinded by the Right.'' He has the revealing sentence, "In 12 years writing for the right wing, not once was my work subject to fact checking.'' Neither was this horrible book.
A28WWT792FY4Q5	July 4, 2002	5.0	Ann's book is an excellent expose' of the liberal thought police.  Her well documented exposure of the media and other facets of the liberal elite lends ample ammunition for those fighting the war for free speech...  One of her characterizations of the liberals really stood out, they are truly snobs who believe they are better than the majority of Americans and therefore, are not required to follow common rules of decency and civility.  Thanks Ann for the doing the needed dirty work of exposing these elites!
A28WWT792FY4Q5	July 4, 2002	5.0	Ann's book is an excellent expose' of the liberal thought police.  Her well documented exposure of the media and other facets of the liberal elite lends ample ammunition for those fighting the war for free speech.  Reading some of the comments provided by those 1-star raters who have not read the book helps support her excellent arguments about liberals and their anathema toward freedom and open debate.  One of her characterizations of the liberals really stood out, they are truly snobs who believe they are better than the majority of Americans and therefore, are not required to follow common rules of decency and civility.  Thanks Ann for the doing the needed dirty work of exposing these elites!
A29237NTYYOZMB	July 4, 2002	5.0	I can't believe that even on the reviews here at Amazon, anyone writing negatively about this book has no substantive argument. The best they can do is one or two sentences of name-calling? As Ann spells out, in the simplest and best-documented terms possible, the Left has no logic--its best described as a mental disorder. Come on Liberals! Wow us with your Ivy League educations and refute EVEN ONE OF ANN's ARGUMENTS!!  Ann covers it all--the Left biased media, the 2000 election fiasco where the Left would do anything to win (how many times do the votes need to be recounted with Bush winning EVERY TIME!) The mythical Christian Right with 1/10 of the political dollar contribution of TRIAL ATTORNEYS. Ann is brilliant on that one--just who exactly are these Christian Right, old ladies playing bingo named Maude? (These old ladies seem to scare the left quite a bit!)  This is a serious book and Ann has been meticulous at footnoting and referencing all the research. Of course, Ann had to document every last detail to mitigate what will sure be an avalanche of fatuous liberal reaction.  Run (don't walk) to buy this amazing book.
A2GU1586AOYW6K	June 27, 2002	4.0	Read an unfavorable review of this book and it will certainly have been written by a liberal. Ann Coulter's piercing and probing book speaks the truth about the liberal bias in this country especially with regard to the major news networks as well as the liberal propaganda used against conservatives in the American political arena; lies, lies and more lies. Tell enough lies over and over again and people will begin to believe them. Due to Ms. Coulter's meticulous research, she is able stand behind everything she has stated in her book. Ms. Coulter is wise beyond her years and I would recommend this book to anyone who is ready to know the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. For 26 years I myself rang the bells and banged the gongs of the liberalist ideals and reviled the conservatives, dismissing them as quickly as I would some annoying insect. Mark my words, the demise of our great nation will not be because of the pollutants in our atmosphere, nor attacks by terrorists, but will be a direct result of the liberalist ideals of "political correctness".
A2KLDXGAUH8967	June 28, 2002	1.0	Too boring to finish.  I suppose her fans will like it, and the talking heads who will promote the book will babble about the supposedly hard hitting prose, but for everyone else it is a waste.
A2KUYYLDQY69TS	June 28, 2002	4.0	Coulter's book is the first time that words and organized ideas have captured the bad tase in my mouth left by spin in the media and politics.  I was extremely pleased to see her analysis backed with invoked evidence to combat the emotionally-based ideas of the left.  I'll take fact over bleedy-heart activism anyday.  It works.
A2XWRURVAO4G5W	July 4, 2002	5.0	To keep it short and sweet, Ann Coulter hits the mark with a humour and direct style. It does not matter where you are politically, Ann makes you laugh and think.
A2ZDXPUYUJCBD1	June 28, 2002	4.0	I've only begun the book, but seeing all the one star ratings, I had to respond. Every charge she makes against liberals is documented and substantially footnoted in the book. Chapter one, she states liberals do not participate in reasonable debate but engage in ad hominem attacks. Now, go read the one star reviews of Ms. Coulter's book. It appears she has struck a liberal nerve. Yes, Ms. Coulter's writing can be shocking, over the top, cutting. She does, however substantiate and provide documentation of her charges. Her writing is a hoot and she builds a solid case. I'd hate to face her in a court of law!
A37M5OB71WPS3	August 23, 2003	1.0	This book was an interesting read.  Ever try to hear children argue? Well, ever heard a one-sided child argument?  If not, then this book will be quite an experience.  Essentially, the book is about 200 pages of "your stupid!" (directed mostly at democrates).  And what's her basis for such an argument? As she claims, the liberals say to conservatives (apparently all the time) "Your stupid!".  Now, Ann Coulter has a lot of good things to say, unfortunately she has no logically coherent way of saying them.  So instead of being a book about how liberal philosophy is inherently flawed and unworkable, she mistakenly assumes this then goes on to say how stupid liberals are for believing such a thing, then goes even further to show how much they hate everyone b/c no one else buys into their argument. From the title of the book you'd THINK it would be about specific lies the left has about conservatives.  However, what she basically did was laboriously point out every single indescretion any popular liberal has done in the last 30 years.  I do not believe Ms. Coulter has any business trying to come off as an intellectual anaylist of politics.  She's a mud-slinger.  All her arguments have NO logical basis(ex. Liberals can't win arguments unless they call you names.  So liberals are stupid!) If you are a dumb liberal and want a good intellectual match, or if your a hardline conservative with no thought process of your own, this is the book for you!
A3P4K6JT2U0K41	June 29, 2002	1.0	I read this book for a laugh. I got that, but I got a lot more. I was scared after reading this book. I was scared that people out there think this is the truth. It sent chills down my spine. I am not a Republican, nor a Democrat; let me just state that her unintelligible arguments are not based on truth, but instead right wing propaganda. In other words she is fighting this supposed liberal propaganda with right wing propaganda...it just makes very little coherent sense. Furthermore, Coulter claims: "In the entire NEW YORK TIMES archives on LEXISNEXIS, there are 109 items using the phrase "far right wing," but only 18 items that use "far left wing," This is true, however, it hardly proves a thing since the very conservative Washington Times has approximately the same ratio. A simple check on LEXISNEXIS shows her figures on the NYT to be correct, yet a simple glance shows what Coulter COUNTED in her 109: 18 ratio. "Then Nick Anderson hit a 3-pointer from the far right wing". Yes people, it is true, she kept that in her count...amazing but true! So I ask, can this woman be trusted to tell the truth, when items like this are occurring? I'll let you be the judge on that one. But my answer is a big firm NO.
A4HZVHSJXVI6D	December 4, 2002	1.0	Whatever "facts" Ann Coulter is able to come up with against liberals, they are quickly colored by her irrationality, bias and hate.  Not a recommended read. In fact, a complete waste of my time.  I am glad of one thing:  I didn't spend my hard-earned money on this book.
A83MR4T0DP6E5	February 1, 2003	4.0	Hopefully Ann Coulter will help to lift the scales from many eyes so that those who are blinded by the mainstream medias bias will discover that the liberals philosophy and way of life: "NO ENEMIES ON THE LEFT" is self destructing----AMERICA WAKE-UP! indeed----the good news is---after the 911 attacks the terrorists HAVE awoken a sleeping giant-------Americans who never got involved and felt it best to keep mum have come out of the closet and are now speaking up------this means hope for a brighter tomorrow for all of us----... you will discover we are NOT alone---for so long mainstream media has convinced us that those of us with traditional values were dinosaurs on the verge of extinction-----Friends----the reverse is true-----MOST Americans STILL believe in whats right--Ann is a breath of fresh air.
AE83CZ4075BH0	August 13, 2003	1.0	If indeed the Liberal consperacy existed, this book would never have been published, and Ms. Coulter would not be featured so prominently on the cable news shows. It brings about a nice chuckle in my face to see the irony of her books "popularity" actually discrediting its primary message. Well done Ann, any critic could not have done any better. P.S.: Love your hair.
AFZSX7COBAHER	September 1, 2003	1.0	As for its informative content, this book is crammed with false or dubious facts. It would fail under any university examination. As for its humour... where is it ??? 8o Just look at the abstract on amazon !!!  Maybe the author shows some wit in her "writing", but certainly not humour. And as someone (was it Voltaire ?) said : "Wit has never proven anything." If you want a really funny read, buy Michael Moore's books. At least, even if you don't agree with his views, you'll be rewarded with a big laugh.
AGDXPDL7NQIJC	June 27, 2003	2.0	A poorly written and researched book, "Slander" attempts to offer reasons why liberal policy and politics are inherently flawed.  Coulter makes broad generalizations and stereotypes all liberals while using inconclusive sources to support her own theories.  Intrisically, Ann Coulter disregards much of her own rhetoric about liberals being closed to alternative viewpoints by dismissing all liberal viewpoints. The intent of this work is clearly to provide a platform for political pundits that wears the guise of credible work.  "Slander" does little to improve the political discourse in the United States, but effectively injects more divisiveness into the discussion.   I would suggest David Frum as an author that more effectively and eloquently articulates the conservative world view.
AOFT9BLLNVQNM	December 2, 2002	2.0	I'm somewhat liberal, and her personal vendetta of generalizing liberals makes her sound as evil as those she hates so much.  Bias, by Bernard Goldberg is a much better book.  I do agree that many liberals name call, avoid the issues, etc., but assuming that ALL of them do it is offensive.  Media should always be critical of what a government or any organization (left or right) is doing; so if that makes them liberal, so be it. A pro-government, "gung-ho" press worries me more. . . She does make valid arguments, and valid arguments should always be welcome.  Goldberg's Bias is much better.
APANNJZ8APH6O	June 28, 2002	5.0	...The professional Ann Coulter-bashers are out in full force. This is a first-rate book written by a first-rate writer and I try to make a point of reading everything she writes. She has talent, courage, intelligence, and she's easy on the eyes to boot which means she's fair game for anyone who doesn't possess any of the above qualities. My compliments to her for saying what needs to be said and for doing so in such an entertaining and forthright manner...
APD3CLYZXF11K	August 22, 2003	1.0	I read this book in the hopes of finding a well reasoned, well organized, well written arguement.  Slander is, in actuality, circular in reasoning and a text book lesson of how not to journalistically support your arguements.  Ann Coulter states her point in a sentence without support and moves on to the next attack, presenting what is opinion as fact.  And the sum of this book comes to attack after attack after attack.  The vast majority of Coulter's support for her stated opinions being editorials and more opinion, what she creates is a structurally unsafe tower of arguement that collapses halfway through the book.  Her arguement culminates in the self-proclaimed patriot's attack on Al Gore for mistaking the national motto as "e pluribus unum" in a speech; that is, however, the correct national moto, not "pluribus e unum," as Coulter contends.  In a half hearted attempt to lambast political opponents for hate and monopolistic control of media and debate, this book is an inadvertent and ironic window into the political and journalistic philosophies of Ann Coulter.  In short -- the title is captivating, and the story is shamefully and embarrassingly disorganized and insulting to the argument Coulter is attempting to make.

AQNSTLK2M3FTP	July 3, 2002	5.0	Coulter is often strident, but there is much more validity in this book than otherwise.  Well worth the money and the time.  The liberal quotes are well documented and amazing.  I strongly recommend giving it a go.
ARKD3407SCZNS	July 5, 2002	5.0	Ms. Coulter articulates everything that I, as a Republican and conservative, feel when I watch or read the news or listen to what passes for political debate from the left. It's a shame the media and the left will ignore the book (as well as Bernard Goldberg's book).  She successfully makes the case that discussion and debate over ideas has been killed by the personal attacks and unbridled hyperbole of the left and the media. She uses footnotes to document every claim and comment (unfortunately necessary from a book coming from the right; the left needs merely to make an accusation without proof). My beliefs have been painted --- without evidence to back such false and ludicrous claims --- as racist, bigoted, mean, evil, homophobic, anti-environmental (yes we conservatives want to destroy the earth, sea and sky --- somehow, I guess we're going to survive in some secretly-constructed bio-dome) and intolerant. The media never brands such claims as hate speech, yet call any perceived criticism of, or fight against, leftist programs and as virulent hate speech that will mobilize the KKK, the right-wing book-burners and abortion doctor killers from fly-over country. Ms. Coulter goes after the New York Times, ABC/NBC/CBS/CNN, news magazines, feminists and Hollywood. Her analysis of the attack on the hugely successful Fox News Channel is superb and enlightening. Ms. Coulter outlines the outrageously idiotic media sensation over the supposed impact a Bush relative (an employee of Fox and a long-term employee of a major network)had on the 2000 Election. How can someone have impact on the vote when they call an election at 2 a.m. --- yet the network (who all use the same information) not had ANY impact when they called the election before all the polls closed in Florida?  Mr. Coulter also documents  the left and the media's hatred of the religion and Christians in general, and it's antipathy towards the citizens and the "oppressed" for which it claims to fight. If you read "Bias" and "Coloring the News," this book takes those subjects forward and looks at the entire agenda for the left and its effective game plan to eliminate real analysis and debate over government programs and our culture. This book is an easy and engaging read. Buy it.
AS2HN4E08M17G	July 13, 2002	3.0	I haven't laughed this hard in years.  "Slander" is easily the best work of comedic fiction since Steve Martin's "Pure Drivel".  I believe it will one day rank among the greatest works of Jonathan Swift in the annals of satire.   Alas, I could not give it a perfect score as the book is far too over-the-heads of the general population and does not go quite far enough.  Though it may be redundant to the intellectual among us, I think it should be stated at the front that this is a work of fiction and meant to be comedic; in small print, of course.   I've read through some of the reviews are there are a few people who seem to be under the impression that Miss Coulter is serious when she says that all liberals should be executed or that the liberals (who want to take God out of all the parts of American life) are working hand-in-hand with Muslim religious fanatics to destroy America - much like the people who believed that Jonathan Swift seriously believed that the Irish should start selling their children as food to get out of debt. I recommend this book to all folks of a left-leaning bent who enjoy a good laugh.
AVBDJZHD5NR28	July 3, 2002	5.0	Ann is so honest and straight forward. It's so refreshing. You can tell she's right about the logic deficiency when you read the name calling and trashing by the other two reviews before mine. I'm willing to bet they're neo-libs. God Bless!
AVHDSGATYGJLG	July 8, 2002	5.0	This book nails the media for some really irresponsible stuff. Many of them have used the first amendment to try to destroy all the rest.  While reading some of the reviews here I noticed something interesting.  All the liberal reviewers, or those supporting that position, did exactly what Ann talks about in her book. They name called, accused her of hate, and just generally bad mouthed conservatives.  There was also at least one I can remember that actualy thinks that when debate starts, democracy ends. Well, to that I can only say good, this isn't a democracy anyway, besides, debate is the hallmark of democracy, or even a Constitutional Repulic!  Every single review here against Ann's position has done more to prove her point than I could ever do.  Thanks, and keep up the good work!
A19CGZEQV469BW	December 9, 2002	1.0	There is only one thing that can be learned from reading this book: The difference between liberal writers and conservative writers is that liberals use actual evidence to backup their opinions while conservatives simply throw their potatoes on the plate with nothing behind them. Coulter's 240-page rant consists of baseless mudslinging at the Democrats as well as other liberals such as the Greens. She defends the Republicans with what she calls "truth under the curtain," claiming that liberals are to blame for every ounce of lost potential progress in the past 50 years. What facts does she have to back up these controversial claims? None, of course. Absolutely none. If you like mindless opinion with no real factual basis, or you just hate Democrats, buy this book. Otherwise, save your dough.
A19ZQH9N3952W7	July 10, 2002	1.0	Now I'm no liberal.  I called for Clinton's resignation and vote by the issue or how I feel about the candidtate, and I am certainly no fan of mainstream media or the Democrats.  But I just can't understand how somebody as successful at Ann Coulter could take such a 1 sided view on so many issues, then proceed to preach using vague anectdotes and not giving any merit to the other side.  If you really want to read a good book on the state of politics and the media today, read "Stupid White Men".  It takes no prisoners and tells it like it is. As for the "Liberal Biased Press", I think the press isn't biased to one side or the other, it just doesn't want to make any waves.  Look at the way it portray's GW, according to CNN he is the greatest thing since sliced bread, and you'll never hear any more about the election
A1I2B5K8V9N7WJ	March 4, 2003	1.0	I started this book with high hopes.  It had been on the bestseller list for months and I was interested in what new theory or point of view the author could present to an open minded reader.  Within the first 2 pages her point and case are made through one word quotations, lifted from numerous sources and, which she slings about with admirable zeal.  And while I can understand the reaction people have to how the 'liberal' media has glossed over topics big and small on both sides of the political spectrum, this book is an insult to anyone who isnt quite so easily marked by a party line.  While some of the reaction to this book has been beyond the pal in terms of rudeness towards the author.  The book is not that good.  As always read for yourself and find out but perhaps give it a skim at your local library before you buy it.
A1K2P6ONQFSDQN	July 9, 2002	1.0	I tire of this endless absolutism.  No single perspective is ever always right...and rarely are they always wrong.  I feel sometimes as if I'm on a Junior High basketball court booing or cheering along with a group of vapid cheerleaders, villifying the other side of the gym with whatever venom I can muster...even when it's obvious they are pretty much just like we are. The fact that she mis-quotes and decontenxtualizes her sources is a real disappointment...it removes one more voice from meaningful public discourse.
A1KRRO84KTFYEJ	June 28, 2002	5.0	Once again, a well-written and entertaining book by Ann.  She has a keen eye for truth - and tells it all with great charm and sometimes biting wit!  The typical responses from the Left are against her character, writing style, and most of all, her meaning - there seems to be a numbing (sort of neurotic) DENIAL from the Left regarding what is often patently obvious and plainly experienced many people.  It takes a gifted writer like Ann to bring forth both the obvious and not-so-obvious liberal slander in our major media (and other institutions)....  The world needs more intellectuals like Ann to boldly state what needs to be stated!

A1OK2U5VY45BY3	October 7, 2002	1.0	This is possibly the worst written piece of tripe I have ever had the misfortune of wasting my time on.  By page 15 I just could not take any more, and I hastened it back to the library from which I had borrowed it.  The only saving grace was that I did not spend a dime on it.  It's tedious, poorly written, unendingly repetitious, and an insult to educated minds.  If there was a rating of less than 1, I'd give it a -10.  Ech, let me get the foul taste of it out of my mouth!
A1WBDPFWM3C6Y6	July 1, 2002	1.0	Ann H. Coulter is a shock-jockey in the same vain as Rush Limbaugh. Whenever I hear some of these over the top, all liberals are the scum of the earth garbage, it just seems that she is desperate to have her views, no matter if they are right or wrong, heared. How can you people on the American right have this woman represent your views? I will admit that liberals have made mistakes and will continue to. But take a look in mirror Ann. The American right has make just as may mistakes and taken advantage of the American public as anybody ever has. Maybe you should listen to John Maccain sometime. His views on social issuses I may not always agree on, but does he ever know what is wrong with Politics in US, yet no one wants to listen to him and clean up the dirty politics in Washington certainly not President Bush. And certainly not Ann H. Coulter.
A1Z3FMIPLGWSFF	July 3, 2002	5.0	Great book! Well written and funny too. Liberals will not enjoyed being uncovered for what they are.
A2VCNZ932TS2TN	July 16, 2002	1.0	Ann Coulter must gotten ahold of the half of Limbaugh's brain formerly tied behind his back. She's managed to produce such a breathtakingly simple minded and factually challenged screed that she's practically inspired a new avocation.  All over the web, one can find chat rooms, weblogs, and serious criticism that chronicle, page by page, many of the gross lies and distortions in "Slander"... If you're determined to waste your money/time on this piece of immature silliness, it would behoove you to do a little investigation. (See the non-profit ...for a comprehensive look at specific claims made in "Slander" and a handy tool to "unspin" much of what's in the print media nowadays.) Only the truly gullible will be fooled or impressed with "Slander's" "research".  Even the slightest debunking effort will reveal many of her sources as taken out of context, misinterpreted, etc..  Likewise her footnotes, while impressive looking at first glance, quickly render into a thin gruel of minimal citations. Did I mention the outright documentable, and documented falsehoods?  The Nexus/Lexus search used to bolster her claims of media bias is just one notorious example.  Of course, Coulter was sure to include plenty of mindless generalities, titillating anti-Clinton invective, and liberal straw man caricatures with which to inflame her paranoid extremist fans. I could go on and on but the sheer quantity of...contained in this book is far to exhaustive and has been better covered elsewhere.  So anyone too lazy to investigate the veracity of this book deserves what they get.  A little extra dose of misinformation and ignorance, and a little less cash. Wait a year and you'll find this one in the "dollar bin" for sure.   If you're the type who enjoys a good chuckle listening to Limbaugh, Hannity, O'Rielly and the other titans of the "Liberal Media", (I used to, but with GW in power, it's just depressing), this book is worth about a buck.  Better yet, get a high speed tape so you won't have to waste your time as well as a buck.
A41AH5NPV3GJH	November 11, 2002	1.0	Let's see if I got this right. Ann Coulter wants to prove that "liberals hate conservatives", and therefore spread vicious lies about them. So how does she prove it? By quoting negative comments made by liberals against INDIVIDUAL conservatives, plus at most 3 or 4 ambiguous POSSIBLE slurs against conservatives in general. Meanwhile, she makes more than 160 vicious slurs against liberals in general; e.g., liberals are "liars", "greedy", "unprincipled", "communists"--- no, wait, they're actually "fascists"---they're "savagely cruel bigots" who "hate ordinary Americans" (a.k.a. conservatives), hate religion, and love abortion.    This book reminds me of the old ethnic gag about a "Polish pistol", (only used once), designed so that the barrel curves back toward the shooter. One would think that her valiant attempts at self-destruction would speak for themselves, but judging by her popularity, there are many people who haven't quite figured that out.    Still, the book certainly has its educational value. One learns, for instance, that George W. Bush won the election "by any count", that the media picked on Bush and pampered Gore, that the verbal blunders of Bush and Quayle have been greatly exaggerated, that Ronald Reagan was the greatest president of all time---and singlehandedly defeated the Evil Empire, that "conservatives read books and liberals don't", that conservatives are innovators while liberals blindly follow tradition, and that the McCarthy Era was a liberal myth. Plus a great many other nuggets of wisdumb too numerous to list.    Given that George W. Bush has been lecturing about corporate accountability, I suppose it shouldn't be too surprising that we should have the likes of Ann Coulter harping on ideological acrimony and dishonesty. I can't wait for Bill Cllinton's sermon on adultery.
A9E6W7YC49DT0	October 4, 2002	1.0	This is the single greatest literary example of the pot calling the kettle black. Ms. Coulter is betting people will be bowled over by her footnotes.  Call her bluff.  Go to the library, take this book and look up some of her footnotes.  Several of the articles she cites do not say what she says they say.  Either she is a liar or she has a severe disability in reading comprehension.  Whichever is the case, it certainly calls into question her credibility as a pundit.
ACP9NRC4ESKJ1	January 2, 2003	1.0	"We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity" Thirteen words from the author are all you need to know about what this book is going to be like. Persumably she wants to convert the Muslims- "Take the Christian and the Jew as your friend" the Koran states clearly, a sentiment of peace not so readily offered in the Bible and by the Right. Perhaps the Islamic world would like to invade America and do unto Ms. Coulter as she would do unto them. Oh by the way, I know what your thinking, I was raised a Protestant, and I despise political correctness and overly-liberal patronisers. This probably doesn't sit too well with how I critisised your beautiful poster girl, does it?
AFM6OEBRZ4KJV	October 6, 2002	3.0	I purchased this book hoping to enjoy more of Ms Coulter's wit and straight-forwardness. Instead I found her paragraphs hard to comprehend and chocked full of phrases that could only be appreciated by a PhD in Thesaurus Science. Did Ann Coulter really write this? Ms Coulter, in my opinion, has gained the admiration of conservatives and even the respect of liberals by her oral communication. It is a shame that her 'sit-up and take notice' style did not come through in her written media. If her editor reads this, please delete her dictionary and disable her thesaurus for her next book. Possibly let her talk into a dictaphone to let her natural, familiar, and relatable persona shine through.  Then let someone else wield the pen(or keyboard). Her messages are enthralling and her passion is compelling. This book contains some dynamic revelations. We still love you, Ann, but I must admit I was disappointed in your writing style.
A32LLQYGRNIP89	June 28, 2002	1.0	Ann Coulter's observations in this book are about as insightful as Bill O'Reilly's assertions that America will win the war on terrorism as soon as the government declares 24-hour armed watch along the entire lengths of both our Mexican and Canadian borders.  Though the parallel between the two is a stretch, I'm sure neither of them would mind it if the government constructed an ideological Great Wall around America tomorrow.  The fact is, Coulter and her ilk manage to so eloquently present the views of  traditionally disenfranchised groups such as Wall Street financiers and compassionate capitalists who one could have found in abundance at such companies as Tyco, Enron, and WorldCom.  The crux of Coulter's own hypocrisy is made clear by the amount of time dedicated to her own smear campaign, along with the failure to delineate a clear direction in her book.  In its entirety, "Slander" is a monstrously horrible rebuttal which quickly assumes the negative characteristics of that which the book purports to criticize.  If one must attempt to stomach the conservative viewpoint, William Buckley Jr. presents a passable notion of mainstream conservatism (if there is such a thing).  As a student at Coulter's alma mater, Cornell University, I can indeed attest to the fact that the University System is completely run by and biased towards liberals (to be more accurate, many of them are actually conservative-liberals who assume the "liberal" title for their own political advancement, but that's another story), which is probably why most of society feels the aftereffects.  At Cornell, Coulter became the first editor-in-chief of the Cornell Review, an inflammatory conservative newspaper whose entire reason for existence is liberal-baiting.  Hence, with this book, Coulter continues her verbal sophistry by attempting to hawk her ideology within the publishing realm.  Stay away from this book at all costs.
A3BVN8HVWFWXE0	June 29, 2002	1.0	She is laughing all the way to the bank. That's America UNFORTUNATELY. She seems very sad though.
APG9HQOZUWJY4	July 1, 2002	1.0	Ann Coulter's basic premise is that Corporate America has created an unstoppable hydra of liberal news media that actively seeks to tell lies about Republicans and exclusively Republicans. It just goes too far.  About half way through this book, she launches in to a story about how news reports on senility increased after Ronald Reagan was re-elected.  If there was such a secret cabal of liberalism that hated Reagan, why would they wait until after he started his second term?  Why not do it during the campaign?  Because Presidents can only be elected twice, it just did not matter once he got into office a second time. I can't believe that "conservative" people are sitting around reading this book and muttering "ditto" to themselves.  It's just too over the top, and most of it comes from a point of view that even the most ardent Republican wouldn't really buy into.  I think the book is more entertaining for "liberal" people to read, and get a chuckle out of, when they think "hey, if CBS and NBC are so darned liberal, how come they constantly skewered Clinton.
AU50R4AJNVTJ7	July 10, 2002	1.0	this bitter woman makes the absurd claim that liberals are poor at debates and resort to name-calling. how would she know? everytime she's on a panel, her tactic is just to scream over everyone else and be as sensationalistic as possible. this woman who routinely accuses democratic leaders of being "america-hating" (real mature, ann) suddenly wants to enliven public discourse?!? ---give me a break to give you an idea of her meticulous "research" to prove her point: she cites FAIR's report "Rush Limbaugh:reign of error". this is an extensive compilation of many, many blantant untruths spewed by limbaugh on the air. she's able to "disprove" ONE. yes, just one. (actually, it's sort of inconclusive who's right. but given page after page of examples by FAIR, this is the best she can offer? hardly legitimizrs limbaugh, as she would have you believe) don't waste your time on this book. buy something by jim hightower or ralph nader. you'll probably learn something. --by the way, ms coulter, democrats are hardly "liberals". they're corporate puppets, just like the republicans.
A1NXMFUS778TG4	July 15, 2002	2.0	...One of the flaws in all party line rhetoric is that it assumes that there are only two sides to any issue. The inability of Coulter to acknowledge there are more political views than her book has pages is a fatal flaw. She clumps all people to the left of her into one simple term: "liberals". Not only is this dishonest for somebody who claims estimable debate prowess, but it casts a dark shadow over her entire book. It says to the reader- American politics has only two sides to each issue; the left (Democrats), and the right, (Republicans). This preschoolish notion ignores the vast dynamic of American politics, since the majority of Americans subscribe to NEITHER party. Note I am going to use the word "conservative". But know I am using it as a way to describe a community of people, not as a catch-word for right-wing political rhetoric, and definitely not as a slur.  Any book that claims to reveal "Slander", if it is meant to be taken seriously, cannot, by definition, slander. Coulter slanders almost everywhere, often with a virile wit. Nonetheless she short circuits any objective purpose her book holds by committing the same crimes she accuses others. Coulter used the old elementary playground rationale, "Well, they did it, so why can't I?" as justification. She's like a rehab counselor who is addicted...She leaves her credibility in the dust jacket of the book, and instead hops on the party train to fame town.     Have you watched her "debate"? Coulter is a three trick pony. She says shocking things so far right Pat Buchanan would faint, she yells as loud as she can to drown out her opponents, and failing that she resorts to the same ad hominim attacks for which she criticizes liberals. That's not a good debating style. News show talking heads like Coulter (on both sides) make broad statements about the "real" intentions of their opponents, and then go around in circles until resorting to name-calling in one form or another. Both "sides" do it, Ann Coulter does it, and it's hard to take seriously a book that claims only one "side" does it!     There is a major difference in the conservative and liberal community. Having a popular book that slanders, accuses, brutally criticizes liberals is an easy way into this tightly knit community of conservative political connections. Rave reviews will flow freely from conservatives. Liberal, moderate, and extreme conservatives absolutely adore anybody who makes an effort to "get the goat" of liberals. It doesn't matter what tactics are used, whether the reporting is biased, rumors presented as facts, quotes and actions are twisted, taken out of context, trumped up to be more than they are, or worst of all, important items omitted for the sake of a predestined conclusion. Despite some reviews here that claim otherwise, Coulter does take part in many of the above, and often. But it won't matter to the conservative community as long as it criticizes the liberal opposition! Conservatives will completely support these people and their work, even if they really disagree with them on a fundamental level about some things. The liberal community is different; they don't circle the wagons when criticizing opponents, and aren't afraid to criticize their own.  David Brock discusses in his book "Blinded by the Right" how he was treated as a veritable God of conservativism when his book "The Real Anita Hill" was published. Looking back in retrospect, he saw all the distortions, slanderous accusations, and outright lies that he peddled in that book. Yet since its ultimate conclusion was in line with the conservative political rhetoric, he was showered with adulation from the conservative community, and became a major player in their club. His future conservative writings were taken as gospel, no matter what questionable journalism they held. I think Coulter is doing the same. Conservative writers have discovered an easy way to the top of their political community- write a book full of vitriol and hate for the opposition, make shocking statements that will be constantly quoted, and soup the book up with verifiable "references".  It doesn't matter that the thesis is fundamentally flawed. You can't prove that the opposition doesn't debate well and resorts to slandering the opponent by taking part in those tactics yourself. That's laughably hypocritical. I'm sure many conservatives will see that, but choose to ignore it. Why? Because her book tows the party line, kow-tows to the interest of the conservative agenda, and therefore it would be blasphemy to criticize her! .   The ol' "liberal media" archetype is thrown around like it's biblical truth. I've read "Bias" and other similar books. There is an element of truth in them; simultaneously, there is also an element of truth in the "right-wing conspiracy" books as well. Both are true to a point, but never to the level that the political rhetoric would have you believe. there isn't an inherent liberal bias in the media. Rupert Murdoch is a hard-line right winger, and he's one of the most powerful media moguls in the world! Limbaugh has 20 million loyal listeners; name one "liberal" political radio star that even approaches half that! It's not the liberal bias of the media, but rather the tendency of liberal leaning people to seek out journalism, television, and news positions. I'm tired of the "liberal media" being used as a scapegoat when people like Coulter realize their brand of radicalism isn't held by a majority in this country. The smaller the numbers of her supporters are, the louder and more shrill her voice will become.
A1Y9QZQ9DHS8QG	December 30, 2002	1.0	thank goodness the liberal media printed "slander". ann coulter can now be exposed for the blowhard she is.
