# Thesis-Opinion-Spam-Detection
Implement a combined methodology to detect spam reviews in Amazon review data as part of my Masters thesis.

1. Create a MongoDB database storing Amazon review data (text, rating, timestamp, product ID, reviewer ID).
2. Build a detection model based on a variety of review spam indicators and reviewer behavior characteristics.
3. Assign a spamicity score to each review via a linear scoring function and mark suspicious reviews.
4. Evaluate on dataset of Amazon product reviews.
